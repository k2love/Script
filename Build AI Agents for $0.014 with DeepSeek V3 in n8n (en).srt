00:00:00,206 --> 00:00:03,566
Today we're going to be walking through how to use DeepSeek v3 in n8n

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,740
for a fraction of what it costs to use something like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

3
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:10,072
But real quick, what is DeepSeek v3?

4
00:00:10,308 --> 00:00:12,341
It's an open source model that was recently released

5
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:15,046
and it pretty much outperforms every other open source model out there.

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,572
And it also performs pretty comparable to the leading

7
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:19,825
closed source models like GPT-4o.

8
00:00:20,195 --> 00:00:23,766
Now, I'm not an expert on models and fine tuning and training and all that kind of stuff,

9
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:25,842
but I've got a couple of graphics that I'll walk through here

10
00:00:25,936 --> 00:00:27,842
and I'll also include the link to the technical report

11
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:29,711
in the description if you guys want to check it out for yourself.

12
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:31,976
So as you can see right here in the blue,

13
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:34,276
we've got DeepSeek and then we've got other models like

14
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,754
Llama, GPT and Claude 3.5.

15
00:00:37,087 --> 00:00:40,115
And it's pretty much outperforming all of them in these six metrics.

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,088
But why did I decide to make this video and why did you probably click on it?

17
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:43,960
Because of the price.

18
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,158
So as you can see here in the green, we've got $0.014 per million tokens.

19
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:52,787
So you can just throw something like $2 in there and it's going to get you a really, really long way.

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,317
Here's another graphic from that report that I was talking about.

21
00:00:55,437 --> 00:00:57,180
This is the needle in the haystack test.

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,276
As you can see, the whole board is green.

23
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:01,680
So, perfect 10 out of 10 score across everything.

24
00:01:01,946 --> 00:01:06,237
This basically tells us that DeepSeek v3 is really, really good with its context length

25
00:01:06,637 --> 00:01:09,428
and understanding everything that's going through and not

26
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:12,501
missing out any information the way that some other models might.

27
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,144
So, something really interesting about DeepSeek

28
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:17,384
v3 is that it uses a mixture of experts model.

29
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:19,853
Rather than having one model across all the parameters,

30
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:23,656
this one has sub-models that it can sort of send out based on

31
00:01:24,028 --> 00:01:27,200
expertise in certain areas, which is pretty cool.

32
00:01:27,458 --> 00:01:31,040
Once again, it's not something I fully understand as far as all the technicalities.

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,152
Go check out that report if you want to read more about it.

34
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:35,278
But this isn't me recommending that it's

35
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:36,855
better or recommending that you should use it.

36
00:01:36,929 --> 00:01:40,720
And of course, you should be careful with the data that you're putting into something like DeepSeek v3.

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,105
But I just kind of wanted to bring you the facts of what I know and

38
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:47,555
how to actually plug it into n8n and just get in there and play around with it a little bit.

39
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:49,160
So, let's get into n8n.

40
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,522
So, today I'm going to be talking about two ways to connect DeepSeek v3 into n8n.

41
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:56,804
So, the first one is hooking it up as the brain for your AI agent.

42
00:01:57,045 --> 00:01:58,171
The chat model for your AI agent.

43
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,462
As you can see right here, it looks like we're connecting to an OpenAI chat model.

44
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,274
But if you click in, you can see that we're actually using

45
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:07,107
an OpenRouter base URL to point us to DeepSeek chat.

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,466
So, that's what's going on here.

47
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:12,167
And then the second way is to use it as sort of its own node,

48
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:14,294
 like a OpenAI message and model node.

49
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:17,087
So, as you can see here, we're doing a post request to DeepSeek

50
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:20,247
and we're sending in information for it to come back with a response.

51
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:24,000
So, I'll real quickly show off these two methods and then we'll get into how you actually do it.

52
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,500
So, first we'll do this one.

53
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,340
As you can see here, it's a post request to DeepSeek.

54
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:31,604
We have our stuff that I'll show you guys how to configure.

55
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,780
And then pretty much in here, what we're asking it to do is we're sending,

56
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:37,280
write me a Facebook post about the following topic.

57
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:40,646
The topic's dynamic based on what we put into this set node right here,

58
00:02:40,718 --> 00:02:42,832
which is health and fitness in 2025.

59
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,600
So, let's fire this off real quick.

60
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,137
As you can see, it's hitting DeepSeek and then it's going to come back to us with a result,

61
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:51,537
which should be a formatted Facebook post

62
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:55,380
with emojis and probably hashtags at the end.

63
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,095
As you can see, health and fitness, the future is here.

64
00:02:57,295 --> 00:03:01,100
It's got a couple points and then it ends with a nice little motivational message.

65
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,344
And if this is confusing to you,

66
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:06,586
it's the exact same way that you would set up an OpenAI message and model node.

67
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:08,119
And you've probably done that multiple times.

68
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,662
You've got a system role right here, which is

69
00:03:10,663 --> 00:03:12,280
we're defining what this node is going to do.

70
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,970
We're just saying you're a helpful assistant.

71
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:18,162
And then we have the actual user role, which is what we want it to take and do,

72
00:03:18,476 --> 00:03:21,728
which is writing a Facebook post about health and fitness in 2025.

73
00:03:22,174 --> 00:03:24,818
So, if that's confusing, just look at it like this, right?

74
00:03:24,952 --> 00:03:27,837
In OpenAI, usually you're set up your different messages.

75
00:03:27,964 --> 00:03:29,860
We've got a system role and then a user role.

76
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,420
So, right here, helpful assistant, write me a Facebook post.

77
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,220
And it's pretty much the exact same thing coming through.

78
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,829
So, that's pretty much all that's going on here.

79
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,064
I just wanted to let this finish so we could see the difference.

80
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:44,166
There we go. So, this was using 4o.

81
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,629
And this one, again, is

82
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:51,840
a little bit different because it uses a different model, but same aspect of Facebook post.

83
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,387
Anyways, now we'll come up here and we'll pretty much do that same thing.

84
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:58,677
So... this is connected to...

85
00:03:59,837 --> 00:04:02,660
what's it called? DeepSeek v3. And we'll do the same thing.

86
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,785
Make a Facebook post

87
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:10,212
about health and fitness 2025.

88
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:12,320
And... okay.

89
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:14,431
So, we actually didn't connect our credential real quick.

90
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,285
We were connected to our OpenAI account, but as you can see, I have a different credential here,

91
00:04:18,363 --> 00:04:20,587
which is the DeepSeek one. So, I'll show you guys how to set this up.

92
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,020
But now this should work fine.

93
00:04:22,415 --> 00:04:24,520
Let's go back in here, send that off.

94
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,295
And I know it's a little confusing because it looks like it's still an OpenAI chat model,

95
00:04:29,358 --> 00:04:33,446
but like I said, all we have to do is grab an API key from OpenRouter

96
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:35,329
and then we'll be good to go to set everything up.

97
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:36,549
Okay. There we go.

98
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:38,082
So, now we got our Facebook post back.

99
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,892
Very similar with its

100
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:43,300
hashtags at the end, with its different emojis for different sections.

101
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:44,552
And yeah.

102
00:04:44,672 --> 00:04:46,880
So, those are the two use cases that we're going to walk over real quick.

103
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,700
So, let's hop into DeepSeek and set everything up.

104
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,527
Okay. So, you're going to go to DeepSeek.com.

105
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,421
You'll come into this screen. You'll sign in or you'll create an account.

106
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,179
And then you're going to click on access API.

107
00:04:57,686 --> 00:05:01,115
So, this is going to take you straight to your API settings. So,

108
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,851
it took me to my usage. As you can see, I put in $2.

109
00:05:03,944 --> 00:05:05,280
I've got over 7 million tokens.

110
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,320
You're going to click on API keys, create new key.

111
00:05:09,606 --> 00:05:10,640
We'll call this one demo.

112
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:13,125
And then you want to copy that and paste it somewhere safe

113
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:15,411
because you won't be able to re-access it.

114
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,383
And you could always just create a new one, but

115
00:05:17,384 --> 00:05:18,766
best practice is to paste it somewhere safe.

116
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,771
Then you need to make sure you have some tokens available. So, just add in like $2.

117
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,520
And then you want to click on docs down here on the left side.

118
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,758
This is going to bring you to this API documentation.

119
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,862
And all you have to do is scroll down right here. We've got a curl.

120
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,363
We're going to copy this curl

121
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:35,960
and it's going to be super easy. We'll hop back into n8n.

122
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,829
As you can see, there's currently no DeepSeek integration.

123
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:41,220
So, what we have to do is grab an HTTP request.

124
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,520
And all we have to do is import curl and paste that right in there.

125
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,406
So, as you can see, it's going to change it to a post request.

126
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,805
It put in the correct endpoint

127
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,516
and has our header already, which is our authorization.

128
00:05:52,896 --> 00:05:55,520
And then it has our JSON already filled out. So, super easy.

129
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,440
Now, what you want to do is you got to go grab that API key.

130
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,286
And then you want to get rid of this.

131
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,880
It's going to be bearer space your API key.

132
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,140
And then make sure there's no extra leading or trailing white space as well.

133
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,313
And that should work.

134
00:06:08,426 --> 00:06:12,680
So, right now, what we're sending over is the prompt is hello to a helpful assistant.

135
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,838
We'll just hit test step to make sure everything's working.

136
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,243
And as you can see, we got back, hello, how can I assist you today?

137
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,800
So, it was responding to the message, which was hello.

138
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,331
So, that's pretty much it.

139
00:06:22,646 --> 00:06:25,609
At this point, you would set up, you know, you could prompt

140
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:29,662
this deep seek node a little differently if you wanted it to do something more specific.

141
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:33,955
And then you could dynamically give the information that you want it to respond to.

142
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:36,089
Okay. Now, to set up a chat model.

143
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:37,480
So, let's delete this one.

144
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,698
We're going to add another one, which is an OpenAI chat model.

145
00:06:39,798 --> 00:06:42,155
And this is like the default way that it pretty much opens up.

146
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,363
And we need to create a new credential.

147
00:06:44,443 --> 00:06:46,836
But before that, we need to set up everything with open router.

148
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:48,336
So, we're going to click add option.

149
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:49,716
We're going to add a base URL.

150
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:55,260
Default, of course, it points to OpenAI because that's the model we're grabbing.

151
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:57,055
But we're going to go to open router.

152
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,240
You'll create an account.

153
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,400
And then all we need to do is go to deep seek v3.

154
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,893
What we want to do here is click on API.

155
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,860
And we're looking for a base URL to point to, to grab deep seek.

156
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,860
So, we're going to grab this right here.

157
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,580
Base URL within the quotations.

158
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,560
Copy that.

159
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,280
Go back into n8n.

160
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,418
Paste that in there. So, now we're

161
00:07:20,284 --> 00:07:21,960
accessing the base URL of open router.

162
00:07:22,256 --> 00:07:25,496
And then up here, instead of accessing GPT-4o mini,

163
00:07:25,548 --> 00:07:27,827
or whatever model you're using, change it to an expression.

164
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,465
You're going to get rid of that.

165
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,880
Go back into open router.

166
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,320
And make sure you're on deep seek v3.

167
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,620
You're going to copy that right here.

168
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,880
Deep seek, deep seek-chat.

169
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,305
And then you're going to paste that in there.

170
00:07:39,511 --> 00:07:45,180
So, now we're pointing to open router URL, which is grabbing this model of deep seek.

171
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,760
And now before we...

172
00:07:47,136 --> 00:07:48,913
Hit out of here. We need to create new credentials.

173
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:51,440
So, you can see I've got a deep seek credential. I'm going to create a new one.

174
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,480
But first, we need to create an API key.

175
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,060
So, you're already in this page.

176
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,660
You're going to click create API key.

177
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,060
You're going to create key.

178
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,280
Name it whatever you want.

179
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,980
And then same thing as always.

180
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,860
Copy this into somewhere safe.

181
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,760
And then you're pretty much just going to go back into n8n.

182
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,100
Hit create new credential.

183
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,100
And paste your API key right into here.

184
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,821
Once you do that, you're going to hit save.

185
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,708
In the bottom right, it's going to go green and say, So it's currently private to you

186
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:20,187
and right here it's going to go red.

187
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,749
Not exactly sure why it does that, but

188
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:24,574
you're connected if you get the green down here.

189
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,297
That might just be a bug, but we're good to go.

190
00:08:27,444 --> 00:08:30,920
So we've got our API key from OpenRouter set up right here.

191
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,915
We have the DeepSeek model that we want,

192
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,940
and then we have OpenRouter being able to access this model for us.

193
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,258
So now we just want to test to make sure it's working.

194
00:08:40,631 --> 00:08:43,508
We're going to open up a chat and we'll do this again, but instead of health and fitness,

195
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,863
we will do sports

196
00:08:47,214 --> 00:08:48,200
what it says here.

197
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,380
And as you can see, it's hitting the model right now, which is obviously DeepSeek,

198
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,820
even though it looks like OpenAI.

199
00:08:53,856 --> 00:08:57,800
And we know that it's working because it would have already failed by now if we didn't have it set up.

200
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,720
As you saw earlier, it failed really quick.

201
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,460
Okay, so it just popped through.

202
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,480
We've got sports in 2025 where innovation meets passion.

203
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,420
Again, emojis, little things.

204
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,940
And remember, this is zero prompting at all, but then it ends with some hashtags.

205
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,528
But yeah, like I said, there's no prompting going on in here.

206
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:16,152
But this is, of course, the chat input that I got and our output.

207
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,176
So that's pretty much going to be it for this one.

208
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:21,684
I know it wasn't too complex, but I just wanted to show you guys how you can access this stuff

209
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:23,456
so you can get in there and start playing around with it.

210
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:26,917
I'm definitely going to play around with a little bit more, some complex agents

211
00:09:27,157 --> 00:09:30,647
with our DeepSeek model and just seeing how it reacts to them

212
00:09:30,996 --> 00:09:32,842
using different tools and stuff.

213
00:09:33,482 --> 00:09:37,868
But two credits in DeepSeek, five credits in OpenRouter.

214
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:40,215
In OpenRouter, you have a ton of different models you can access as well,

215
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,801
but those credits will get you a long way for sure. But yeah, as always, if you found this one helpful,

216
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:45,456
please give it a like, definitely helps me out.

217
00:09:45,865 --> 00:09:46,511
Great to be back.

218
00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:48,420
Hope you guys all had a happy new year.

219
00:09:48,728 --> 00:09:51,887
I'm really excited to see what 2025 brings as far as the channel,

220
00:09:52,004 --> 00:09:53,458
the AI space, all that kind of stuff.

221
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:56,695
And definitely let me know in the comments what else you guys are looking to see

222
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,766
in the next few weeks, in the next few months, and in the next year.

223
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:01,920
So thanks for making it to the end of this one, guys.
