00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,740
Hello my friends, how are you doing?

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:10,320
Today I want to take you on a journey that is probably going to change your life.

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,118
We are going to have a lot of fun with ConfUI and I'm going

4
00:00:14,142 --> 00:00:18,520
to show you why it is so capable and such an amazing tool.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,420
I want you to imagine ConfUI as a canvas on which you doodle.

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:30,020
Imagine yourself as a kid and you just draw out anything that is in your mind,

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:36,320
in your fantasy because ConfUI is absolutely adaptable and open.

8
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,877
So in this video, in this lesson, we're going to talk about the basic

9
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:45,500
functionality and how to understand it and create in an easy and fun way.

10
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,460
Here we have a very simple work flow that is just creating this very nice image here.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,297
You can see here there's different elements in here and we have here these

12
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:57,940
lines that are connecting everything together.

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,520
So we're going to build that together but before we do

14
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:04,680
that I'm going to show you how the interface itself works.

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,960
So let's start fresh here with this element.

16
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,280
You can move that around any way you want it on the screen.

17
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,380
Here you have several controls in there and there might be something you don't have.

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,297
This is the manager and that is very important because here you can install all

19
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:26,040
of the custom nodes which are these little boxes we have just seen.

20
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,340
Now this is very very easy to install.

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,797
You need to go to the github page of the CompFUI manager and then you want to

22
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:37,557
scroll down a little bit... and here you see this text line..

23
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:41,440
Git clone and then the web address of the CompFUI manager.

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,460
You want to select all of that and copy that.

25
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,660
Then you're going to go into your CompFUI Windows Portable folder.

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,660
In there in the CompFUI folder... in there into the custom nodes folder.

27
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,477
And when you're here you want to click up here in the address bar and type This is

28
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:05,055
going to open up your command window and

29
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,680
here you simply paste what you copied before.

30
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,601
Now that the text is in here, you simply hit

31
00:02:10,625 --> 00:02:12,860
enter and wait for it to finish downloading.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,600
It should only take a couple of seconds.

33
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,777
After you've done that, you can close the command window and you're going to click

34
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:24,320
here in the confui windows portable folder again on run nvidia gpu bat.

35
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,756
This is going to start confui for you and is

36
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,300
finishing the installation of the manager.

37
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,980
Once you have that and you see this button here, click on that and you will see this.

38
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:39,940
There's a lot of different buttons in here but they are all easy to understand.

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,320
There are three buttons that are very important for you.

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,660
One is the update all button.

41
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,220
And over here you might get a message that your confui is outdated.

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,600
So you can click on that and wait for it to finish.

43
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,900
This will update confui and all of the custom nodes that you have installed.

44
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,529
The second one The last one that is very important

45
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:03,380
for you is the install custom notes button here.

46
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,320
You can click on that and this is going to open up a list for you.

47
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,625
You can see on the right side when you already have installed

48
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:13,660
notes, you can either disable them or uninstall them.

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,820
Disabling might be useful when they are conflicting with other custom notes.

50
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,420
And of course you also have an install button so you can go and install it from here.

51
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,437
You don't even have to go to the GitHub page anymore.

52
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:31,180
Now here are some of the note packs that I want to suggest to you.

53
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,920
One is called the confui impact pack.

54
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,760
The other one confui inspire pack.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,979
The efficiency notes for confui, the ultimate SD upscale

56
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:46,500
and then also the confui confi roll custom notes.

57
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,960
Because these have some of the most used custom notes in them.

58
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,240
Another thing you might want to do in here is to install models.

59
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,540
When you click on that you will have here a list of models.

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,448
Now you will realize that these are often not models

61
00:04:02,472 --> 00:04:05,500
that you are using for image generation itself.

62
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,620
For example up here this one for example is very good.

63
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,320
The 4x foolhardy remakri.

64
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,980
The 4x ultra sharp is also very good.

65
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,800
The 8x nmkd super scale 150,000 g also very good.

66
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,640
And you can actually see on the left side by the type what it is.

67
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,969
Now you see here we have upscale, inside face, face

68
00:04:28,993 --> 00:04:32,380
restore, we have checkpoints, we have embeddings and so on.

69
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,240
Don't be too much concerned about that right now.

70
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,760
We don't need all of that at this moment.

71
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,000
Before we get started you might want to do one more thing.

72
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,600
You will find the file extra model paths yaml example.

73
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,160
Now you want to delete the dot example part at the end so it's becoming a yaml file.

74
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,120
And then you can open this up.

75
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,415
Personally I'm using for that the notepad plus plus software

76
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:00,760
but you can use any kind of text editor if you want to.

77
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,197
Now if you already have for example automatic 11.11 installed what you want to

78
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:13,157
do is to set the base path to your automatic 11.11 and in there to the web ui

79
00:05:13,181 --> 00:05:16,729
folder and then this will automatically link to

80
00:05:16,753 --> 00:05:20,181
these other folders here with the same structure.

81
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,893
So that means it loads all of the models that you have from automatic 11.

82
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:28,500
11 without having them as a duplicate on your hard drive.

83
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,157
You want to save that and you can close all of that and then you can click in the

84
00:05:33,181 --> 00:05:38,817
menu here on refresh so it's loading all of the models or alternatively you can

85
00:05:38,841 --> 00:05:43,340
simply restart comfui if you want to make sure that everything is loading correctly.

86
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,180
Now where do we find the nodes and where do we create that?

87
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,760
Here is one advice I want to give you.

88
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,548
You can zoom in and out with your mouse wheel and when you do

89
00:05:55,572 --> 00:05:59,500
so you will realize there's a very thin blue line around here.

90
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:04,797
Now this is the starting area of your canvas so when you start to build make

91
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:07,980
sure that everything is inside of that blue line.

92
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,877
You can go over the blue line but the core of your work flow should be inside of that

93
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:16,618
blue rectangle here because next time you load your

94
00:06:16,642 --> 00:06:20,220
work flow it's loading that area of the work flow.

95
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,180
Next of course we want to add some nodes in here.

96
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,740
The easiest way to do this is to double click on the canvas.

97
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,800
This is going to give you this search window.

98
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,840
Here you can see you can scroll through all of the nodes.

99
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,440
But even better you can type up here what you want to have for example understand

100
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,620
this is for creating the images.

101
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:44,220
Now we want to click on that and you can see this is adding the node for us.

102
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,297
So this is super simple and of course you need to know the name of the node but over

103
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:53,597
time because Because you, in most cases, use the same notes, you will remember the

104
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,570
names over time, or you can look them up in other

105
00:06:56,594 --> 00:07:00,800
work flows or ask in the Discord communities for ConfUI.

106
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:06,280
So in here you see we have some inputs here for the model, positive prompt,

107
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,713
negative prompt, the latent image, which is the latent

108
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:12,900
noise or anything you want to input as a latent image.

109
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,297
And then we have some settings here, like the seed number.

110
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:21,177
You want to have here maybe randomizing the seed, but you can also choose here

111
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:25,660
from these pop down menus, for example, have a fixed seed for every generation,

112
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,760
the same seed or increment or decrement.

113
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,240
Increment means it goes up one number, decrement means it goes down one number.

114
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,980
So you can see in these choices here, we have different kind of data inputs.

115
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:43,560
Here we have a pop down menu, while here we have a number.

116
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,640
These are full numbers with no decimal point.

117
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,601
And down here for the CFG, for example, we do have

118
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:54,040
numbers where you can have a decimal point in there.

119
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,300
So these are called floats and these are called integer numbers.

120
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,460
Then you have a sampler in here.

121
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,620
You see it's a long list.

122
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:06,440
There's also a filter here where you can search for what you want to use.

123
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,117
And then below that, you have a scheduler.

124
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:12,180
Now, this is something you don't have in Automatic 11.11.

125
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,100
And this here actually gives you more freedom.

126
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,437
First of all, you can see there's more schedulers in

127
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:20,760
here, but then also you can combine them any way you want.

128
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,280
So, for example, when you go in here and you have, for example, DPM++ SDE,

129
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,793
there is no Keras version because you select this

130
00:08:30,817 --> 00:08:34,120
and then separately you select Keras in here.

131
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,780
So this gives you more combination, more abilities for experimentation.

132
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,600
Below that, we have the denoise that is similar to image to image rendering.

133
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,953
So basically, in any step in COM4UI, you can do

134
00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:51,560
image to image because you want to be more flexible.

135
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,960
You have a lot more ability inside of COM4UI.

136
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,620
Now, how about these connection points here?

137
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,760
On the left side, you will always have the inputs.

138
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,300
On the right side, you will always have the outputs.

139
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,864
When you click and drag, this is turning into one of

140
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:11,600
these noodles or cables and you can let go of them.

141
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,860
And this will suggest to you something that might be useful to connect.

142
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,039
You can also click here on search to have the search

143
00:09:19,063 --> 00:09:21,740
window again if you want to search for something else.

144
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,049
Another functionality that you have in here that

145
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:27,000
is often very important is called the reroute.

146
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,560
Now, this gives you this little element here.

147
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:34,757
Now, the interesting thing, let's move this over here is I can, for example,

148
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:38,692
let's create a little bit more reroutes here and pretend that

149
00:09:38,716 --> 00:09:42,320
these are other nodes that we are using for other things.

150
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,040
Now, let's say I have another case sampler down here.

151
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,380
Let's simply copy that down here.

152
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,632
And I want to reconnect all of these to the

153
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:54,580
second case sampler instead of the first one.

154
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,803
Instead of going through all of them, I can simply

155
00:09:57,827 --> 00:09:59,860
go now like this and I've switched everything.

156
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,740
So that is very useful.

157
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,620
But there is also a second important purpose for these reroute nodes.

158
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,400
This can give you a lot more clarity in your work flow.

159
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,140
So let's say, for example, the cable runs like this.

160
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
And I have a node sitting here like that.

161
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,426
So this is going behind the node and it might

162
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,880
get very confusing of what's actually happening.

163
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,805
So instead, you can use these reroute nodes to have

164
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:29,620
this go around that and by that creating more clarity.

165
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:35,337
Now, there's also another reason for using these reroute nodes, and that is to make

166
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:38,860
your work flow cleaner and easier to understand.

167
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,777
So, for example, here you can see we have a lot of cables that go all over the place.

168
00:10:42,801 --> 00:10:45,756
This can become very visually cluttered.

169
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:50,620
So instead, we can use this reroute node to put it simply closer to it.

170
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,504
And by that, we have only one cable going over here while

171
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,960
the others simply go to the other nodes in a shorter path.

172
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,720
And this makes it much easier to understand.

173
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,607
Now, let's have another look at our starting node

174
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:06,780
here because there's a lot more you can do with that.

175
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,649
You can see here on the left side we only have four

176
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:12,501
different inputs and then all of these choices.

177
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,440
But what if you want to have, for example, the seat being controlled from the outside?

178
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,037
An example for that could be that you're using multiple case samplers, but you want

179
00:11:22,061 --> 00:11:25,300
to use the same seat in each of these case samplers.

180
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,260
So for that, what you could do here is right click.

181
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,280
And then down here you have a selection of convert seat to input.

182
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,840
So all of these controls can be converted to input.

183
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,281
So when I click on that, you can see that now

184
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:42,501
the seat is gone and I have an input for that.

185
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,620
I can now create a seed node and connect that.

186
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,861
And as I said before, here we have now two

187
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:53,060
case samplers that are fed by the same seed.

188
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,612
So when this is randomized, it is creating one randomized

189
00:11:56,636 --> 00:12:00,040
number that then is going out to both of these case samples.

190
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,180
So both of them always use the same seed number and that can be very helpful.

191
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,339
If you no longer need that input, you can

192
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:12,120
always right click again and then set this back.

193
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,940
So down here you see convert seed to widget.

194
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,657
So when you click on that, this is removing the input and now you have here

195
00:12:19,681 --> 00:12:23,240
the setting again inside of the case sampler.

196
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,920
There's also more things you can do to customize your node.

197
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,980
For example, you can change the title up here.

198
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,200
For that, right click, go to title and then in here you can add something.

199
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,341
Now I would suggest to you to keep the

200
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:38,736
original name and then add something behind it.

201
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,400
For example, let's say anime.

202
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,817
So this is for example the case sampler for the anime style that we want to create

203
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:50,000
so that you know what kind of node it is and also what it is for.

204
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,000
This is important so you have clarity over what is happening and why you're using it,

205
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,960
especially when you come back to your work flow days or weeks later.

206
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,140
Another thing you can do to create more visual

207
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:04,800
clarity is to change the color of your node.

208
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,060
So you right click again.

209
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,440
You can see here we have color.

210
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,320
And with that, for example, I can change this to green.

211
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,420
And you could, for example, switch all of your case samplers over to green.

212
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,905
So when you look at your work flow, you know

213
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:21,620
exactly where all of the case sampler nodes are.

214
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,260
Another thing you can do to stay better organized is to create groups of nodes.

215
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,740
For that, you want to right click on the canvas and then select add group.

216
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,460
This will give you a colored box.

217
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:38,340
I often put this above my nodes and then you can drag this out over all of the nodes.

218
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,500
If you want, you can make it a little bit shorter and then move the nodes inside.

219
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,252
Now this gives you an area that now combines all of

220
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:48,980
them together so you can move them around together.

221
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,040
You can also bypass all of them together.

222
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,140
So you can right click here and then select bypass group nodes.

223
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,000
Everything is going to turn Violet.

224
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,757
This means it's bypassed.

225
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:01,620
It's not being used at the moment.

226
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,330
And you can undo that by again right clicking

227
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:08,736
and then select set group nodes to all nodes.

228
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,760
Like this.

229
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,240
Now here's a fair warning.

230
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,900
This is a sticky area.

231
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,357
So that means if you move this area over any other node, even if you only touch it

232
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:22,080
a little bit, it will become part of the nodes.

233
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,960
You have to be a little bit careful where you're putting your groups.

234
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,256
And if something sticks to it, you can simply move it out of the way.

235
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,380
And then it's outside of the group again.

236
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,440
Also for any individual node, you can also bypass them.

237
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,736
You do that by right clicking on the individual node.

238
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,640
And then select bypass.

239
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,880
And if you want to reactivate them again, right click on the node.

240
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,520
And in this case, also select bypass.

241
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,140
And this will activate them again.

242
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,300
This also works for nodes inside of groups.

243
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,980
So you can turn off individual nodes inside of a group.

244
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,860
Thanks for watching and check out my next lesson.

245
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,440
Oh, you're still here.

246
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,820
So this is the end screen.

247
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,800
There's other stuff you can watch like this or that's really cool.

248
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,736
And yeah, I hope I see you next time.

249
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,080
I'll see you soon.

250
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,180
Leave a like if you haven't yet.

251
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,700
And well, yeah.
