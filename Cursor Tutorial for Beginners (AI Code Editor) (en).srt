00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,057
Today we're checking out Cursor AI, an AI-powered code editor that promises to

2
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:07,420
make your development significantly easier.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,640
Now I've been using this for the past few weeks.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:13,497
It's pretty interesting and I wanted to make a quick tutorial on it to share with

5
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:17,557
you what I've learned and some of the best practices that you can apply, especially

6
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:19,520
if you're a more beginner programmer and you

7
00:00:19,544 --> 00:00:21,660
haven't used a ton of these AI tools before.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,420
You don't know exactly how they work and how to get the best results out of them.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,580
So with that said, let's dive into it and let's learn about how to use Cursor AI.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,556
Now at this point, I'm going to assume that you've downloaded it.

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,820
If you haven't, give it a shot.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,300
It's free.

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,060
There also is a paid version if you want some more features and unlimited usage,

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,297
but I'd recommend even if you're an experienced developer, because it is

15
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:44,137
pretty cool and it kind of makes you question how you've been working in the

16
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:46,660
past and if this is something that you might want to switch to.

17
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,541
Anyways, once you've got Cursor AI open, what

18
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:51,960
I recommend doing is just opening a new folder.

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,260
So to do that, you can go to file and then open folder.

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,620
And then from here, you can just make a new folder on your desktop, for example.

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,620
And open it up.

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,357
That's because a lot of beginners actually just work in whatever the default folder

23
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:06,437
is that it starts you in, and then they can kind of lose their work if they don't

24
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:08,393
know where that folder location is, or it can

25
00:01:08,417 --> 00:01:10,320
be a bit more difficult to get back to it.

26
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,117
Now, especially if you're a beginner here, what I'd recommend doing before you start

27
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:18,260
using any of the features that I'm going to show you is making a little bit of a plan.

28
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,680
AI works best at solving really small, discrete, detailed tasks.

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,757
The more specific you can be, the more context and information you give to your

30
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:30,036
task, the better results you're going to get.

31
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,157
You'll notice if you just ask it to do something like generate me a to do list

32
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:38,057
application or give me a portfolio website, or you give it like a really

33
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:42,957
general one or two sentence long task, you can get wildly different results and

34
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:44,676
something that you're not looking for at all.

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,357
And once it starts going in one direction, it can kind of branch and just bring you

36
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:51,340
all over the place if you don't know what you actually want.

37
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,756
So make sure you know what you want.

38
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,240
You have a clear vision of what it is that you want to build.

39
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,657
And I highly recommend at least jotting down some notes, or even just writing down

40
00:01:58,681 --> 00:02:01,857
some notes, even drawing out a picture of what you want the user interface at

41
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:03,500
minimum to look like, because that's really

42
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:05,981
going to help guide you through this process.

43
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,440
Anyways, let's imagine you've got a plan at this point, you know what you want to do.

44
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,736
And you've kind of thought about it at least for a few minutes.

45
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,640
The first feature I want to show you here is the compose feature.

46
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,556
Now or the composer feature, whatever you want to call it.

47
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,997
Now in order to enable this, you're going to have to go to file and go to

48
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:27,320
preferences, cursor settings, and then click on features here.

49
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,637
And if you scroll down, you should see the composer and then you can enable it by

50
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:34,060
just selecting enabled, I think by default is disabled.

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,840
So that's why I'm mentioning that to you.

52
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,700
Okay, so now that we've got that, what we can do is press Ctrl I,

53
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,120
and that's going to open up the composer view.

54
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,040
If you're on Mac, it's going to be Command I.

55
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,926
Now this is what can actually edit multiple files

56
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,920
at the same time and create new files for you.

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,500
So this is what I like to start with when I'm generating a brand new application.

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,937
And then if I want to do a major feature change, or there's something that's going

59
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:58,423
to apply to a ton of different applications, or

60
00:02:58,447 --> 00:03:01,000
sorry, a ton of different files, I'll use this.

61
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,616
Okay, so first thing I'm going to do, I'm just going to open the control panel.

62
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,480
So it's a bit larger.

63
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,736
And I can kind of see this here.

64
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,220
And I'm going to ask it exactly what I want it to do.

65
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,857
Alright, so I've written a quick prompt here,

66
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:12,481
you guys can read through it if you want.

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,940
But the important thing is that I'm specifying exactly what I want it to do.

68
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,000
And I'm telling it what framework languages, etc, I want it to use.

69
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,100
And if you don't know, you can ask it to recommend to you which ones you should use.

70
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,297
But I do recommend doing a bit of research before you just dive into this and use

71
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:30,540
like a random language or a random framework.

72
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,657
And you can actually ask other AIs or even the one inside of this app, which I'll

73
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:37,897
show you in a minute, hey, I want to build this type of application, what's the

74
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:40,682
simplest way to do that, and then I can give you some recommendations.

75
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,837
Point is, I'm asking it that I want to use Express, which is a JavaScript framework

76
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:48,960
for the back end, SQLite for storing the recipes, which is my database.

77
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,460
And I want to use JavaScript, HTML and CSS with Tailwind for the front end.

78
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,296
Okay, so I'm just going to hit enter here.

79
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,552
And what's going to happen is it's going to

80
00:03:56,576 --> 00:03:58,780
start generating a ton of different files for me.

81
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,297
So it will give me some instructions because it can't quite do everything like

82
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,821
running, for example, terminal commands, but

83
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,176
it can generate a majority of the applications.

84
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,880
Let me zoom out a little bit, just so that we can see this a bit better.

85
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,540
Okay.

86
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,980
And let's go back here.

87
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,297
Alright, so you can see that it is generated the server for me, we have the

88
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:23,180
index, we have style, we have script, we'll just wait for that to finish.

89
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,006
And then we can actually just accept all of

90
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,980
these changes, and it will apply to our app.

91
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:27,780
Alright, so finished.

92
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,857
Now I can go and I can look at all of these files, I can ask it for revisions to

93
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:33,920
change things around pretty much whatever I want.

94
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,080
And then I can just accept all of these changes, or I can accept one file at a time.

95
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,949
So I'm going to go accept all and this is very similar to

96
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:43,281
what you do in like a GitHub pull request or something.

97
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,876
And you can see that it's going to generate these files for me.

98
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,216
So let me get out of the composer view.

99
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,820
Now I have my index, my script, my styles and my server.

100
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,077
Okay, so that is the first feature that is the composer very useful for generating

101
00:04:55,101 --> 00:05:00,360
bigger features, a lot of but sometimes it can get a little bit crazy.

102
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,640
And also, it's difficult to review all of the code that's inside of there.

103
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,980
So I want to show you the next feature that I found myself using the most.

104
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,679
And this is the kind of the general chat

105
00:05:08,703 --> 00:05:10,660
view, I'm not sure exactly what they call it.

106
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,980
But if you hit Ctrl I or Command I, you're going to get into this chat.

107
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,260
Now in here, you don't actually have to ask anything coding related.

108
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,040
But this does have access to the entire context of your code base.

109
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,620
So you can ask about a particular file, and it can go and look for that.

110
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,320
Or you can specify context So what I can do is press.

111
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:32,101
Add, for example, and I can add different files.

112
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,269
So if I want to ask a question about my

113
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:36,440
server file, I just put server inside of here.

114
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,820
Now I can also do things like ask it to search on the web, I can give it an image,

115
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,520
I can, what is it link different documentation.

116
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,457
So if I go to app mention, you see, I can give it a PDF file, I can give it a

117
00:05:47,481 --> 00:05:51,240
folder code web docs get like there's so many different options here.

118
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,600
And the more context you can give this, the better it's going to perform.

119
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,401
So feel free to go in here and mention a specific file or

120
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:01,400
mention, like a website that you want it to go and read from.

121
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,537
For example, if there's like a brand new feature or framework, you could link the

122
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:08,288
documentation to that, and then get it to read

123
00:06:08,312 --> 00:06:10,440
that before it generates you the response.

124
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,840
Okay, so anyways, let's say we wanted to do something inside of server.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,360
So I can say server, I say, Okay, this is nice, but I want to add,

126
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,736
for example, more recipes.

127
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,960
So say, Okay, great.

128
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:28,260
Can you add some new recipes, please make them more unique.

129
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,200
Okay, so let's hit enter.

130
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,320
And let's see what we get.

131
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,980
Alright, so we got some code here.

132
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,420
And we could just manually copy this in, we also can press apply, if we do that,

133
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,280
it's actually going to make a diff inside of the file.

134
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,671
So you can see that it's showing us exactly

135
00:06:42,695 --> 00:06:44,880
what it's going to add right inside of here.

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,840
And this is completely different from something like chat GPT, where if you had,

137
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,580
you know, comments like existing code or insert sample data or whatever,

138
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,900
you need to actually like copy parts of this and kind of splice it into your file.

139
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,000
Here, this can just do for you.

140
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,860
So what I'm going to do is just accept this.

141
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,500
And you see that now we just get more recipes added inside of here.

142
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,810
And by the way, if I didn't like this, I could just

143
00:07:06,834 --> 00:07:09,300
reply to it directly here with this ask button.

144
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,200
Now it's referencing this particular response.

145
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,121
And I can say something like, Hey, I don't

146
00:07:14,145 --> 00:07:15,920
like this recipe, swap it out with this one.

147
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,700
So just a really quick way to inject that context.

148
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,407
And again, the context is so important when you're coding,

149
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:24,500
you want to give this as much information as you possibly can.

150
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,300
That's how you get the best replies.

151
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,680
So that's the chat window.

152
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,600
I think it's pretty straight.

153
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:28,920
Let's move it forward.

154
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,500
You can mention the context.

155
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,836
You can choose the different model you want to chat with.

156
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,160
You can link documentation.

157
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,706
And while we're here, I will mention that there is actually

158
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,100
the option to kind of search through your code base.

159
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,797
So you can just do the default chat, which is hitting enter or pressing this

160
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:48,260
button, or you can do something like say, you know, where are my recipes defined?

161
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,812
So if you're looking for a specific piece of code, maybe

162
00:07:50,852 --> 00:07:53,216
you're in a huge code base, it's kind of difficult to navigate.

163
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,532
And then you can press on this button and it's

164
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:57,817
actually going to search through the whole code base.

165
00:07:57,841 --> 00:08:00,980
You can also do control plus enter or command plus enter.

166
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,977
Obviously more effective in a larger code base, but you see it now tells us kind of

167
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:09,060
where this is and gives us the links to the different variables, to the files.

168
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,282
And notice I can actually click on these and go to

169
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:14,000
exactly where they are, which is pretty interesting.

170
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,580
So if I go to sample recipes, brings me to that variable.

171
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,242
Anything that's blue is click able and it's really

172
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,380
kind of easy to navigate through the code base.

173
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,060
Okay.

174
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,160
So that's the chat window.

175
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,940
A lot of stuff you can do here, especially with the context.

176
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,260
But now what I want to talk about is kind of the inline completions.

177
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,634
So while we're typing code, like let's say

178
00:08:31,658 --> 00:08:33,740
we actually want to edit something ourselves.

179
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,679
So if we go to, for example, index. Html, maybe what I

180
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:40,700
want to do is add another select box for some reason.

181
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,642
So I'm going to say, okay, select, and then notice

182
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,660
right away, it gives me really long auto-completion.

183
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,676
So if I hit tab, that's going to complete it for me.

184
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,660
I can press enter, go inside of here.

185
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,822
It's already given me a bunch of options and I can

186
00:08:52,846 --> 00:08:56,300
generate code significantly faster using these.

187
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,940
So this is the kind of the same way one that I already had, but if I wanted to,

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,037
I can change this around and rather than mood select, I'm going to go maybe time

189
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:07,560
select or something, and then we'll have an option.

190
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,000
And what else are we going to do here?

191
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,560
Breakfast, lunch, dinner.

192
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,380
Okay.

193
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,140
Let me just press tab correctly here.

194
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,800
And you can see that I can kind of insert those inside.

195
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,520
Nice.

196
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,020
Now let's say maybe I just want to modify this block of code here.

197
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,720
I can highlight on it and then I have two options.

198
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,257
I can chat with it, control I, or I can do control K and control K is

199
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:32,040
going to bring up kind of the inline editor.

200
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,640
So if I do control K, I can give this instructions on what I want it to do with this.

201
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,660
So I can even just say something like delete this.

202
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,297
I don't know why I would do that, but I could, and you can see now it

203
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:45,940
generates the diff and then I can accept that, or I can reject it.

204
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:52,580
And if we go back here, I'll say, add some more detailed options, please.

205
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,360
Okay.

206
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,160
Let's hit enter.

207
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,714
And then it, again, will give me the diff and you can see

208
00:09:56,738 --> 00:09:59,080
that it has early breakfast, breakfast, lunch, et cetera.

209
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,380
Okay.

210
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Let's accept that.

211
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,360
And there you go.

212
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,700
Now we have our options.

213
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,917
So as kind of a mini recap, if you want to generate a ton of files, you're creating

214
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:09,320
new files, you're doing like a big feature change.

215
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,580
It's going to be touching a lot of the areas of code.

216
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,985
Then if you open up the composer with control I or command.

217
00:10:15,009 --> 00:10:17,800
I, you can make a new composer or use an existing one.

218
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,681
And then you can read through all of these files, like something

219
00:10:20,705 --> 00:10:24,160
like a GitHub pull request and kind of make changes that way.

220
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,317
Now, if you want really smaller kind of targeted, modifications, you can just

221
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:32,200
highlight lines of code and you can hit, for example, control K.

222
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,960
When you do this right in line in your code, that opening up that other window,

223
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,600
you can make the change.

224
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,596
So this is like a really fast way to change it in

225
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,980
the editor when you know exactly what you want.

226
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,557
And then if you want something that's kind of in between that, and maybe doesn't even

227
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:49,640
have to do with a code change, you can open up the chat window.

228
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,380
Now here, you can ask pretty much anything that you want.

229
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,660
You can get it to recommend changes and then directly apply those.

230
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,340
You can also ask it to, for example, explain code.

231
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,480
So maybe, you know, I copy this and I paste this inside of here.

232
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,880
Notice that context is automatically added when I do this and I can say, Hey,

233
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,500
can you, you know, explain these lines, please.

234
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,720
Okay.

235
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,782
And now it's going to go there, explain it and

236
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:15,040
kind of give me a description of what's going on.

237
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,620
So the chat windows more for that.

238
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,526
Whereas in here, it's to make a change and actually

239
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:22,201
modify a section of the code in a more targeted approach.

240
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
So that's cool.

241
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,334
The last major feature I want to show you is that

242
00:11:26,358 --> 00:11:29,380
we can actually use images to generate code as well.

243
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,200
So let's do that.

244
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:30,720
Okay.

245
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,613
So I just grabbed a kind of random image here

246
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:35,280
from the web of like a really simple login form.

247
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,817
Now, obviously you'd maybe take like a Figma file or something, a designer

248
00:11:38,841 --> 00:11:41,478
sending to you, but the point is you can take an image and you

249
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:44,340
can pass it here and get it to generate code based on that.

250
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,100
So what I can do is pick the image.

251
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,700
So let's go.

252
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,220
I think it's this one right here.

253
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,980
It's going to show up.

254
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:56,860
I'm going to say, can you please make a new HTML file that contains this form,

255
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,740
make it look exactly like this.

256
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,056
And let's see what we get.

257
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,045
So it generated some HTML, but notice if I press on

258
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:09,120
apply, it's trying to apply that into my index.html.

259
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,640
Now I wanted a new file.

260
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,556
And that's one of the things that this kind of gets wrong a lot in the chat.

261
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,600
It's not going to make the new file for you unless you use the composer.

262
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,540
So I need to make a new file myself.

263
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,480
So I'm just going to go form.html.

264
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,300
Okay.

265
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,576
And then I'm going to apply this.

266
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,700
So I'm going to click cancel, go back into form.

267
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,220
When forms open, it's going to default to using that.

268
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,877
And I'm going to go to apply notice it now says form. Html, and then you'll see that

269
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:35,540
it kind of pops in here and then I can accept this.

270
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,120
So I'm going to hit control shift Y to accept that.

271
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,760
And then let's open this up.

272
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,356
Cause I want to see what it actually looks like.

273
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,920
So let's reveal in file Explorer, let's open the form.

274
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,500
And that is pretty impressive that that is already created.

275
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,920
So if we go back to the image, I was not expecting it to be that good.

276
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,460
Uh, let me open up the image again.

277
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,097
This is what the image looks like.

278
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:58,080
And this is the result that we got now.

279
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,280
Sure.

280
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,317
There's a bit of an issue with the spacing, but at least this like diagonal

281
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:04,220
line got filled in, which I was expecting it not to do.

282
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:04,820
Yes.

283
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,380
There's some issue with the padding and the font, but generally that's pretty close.

284
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,920
Um, and that's pretty impressive.

285
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,236
Again, I was not expecting it to give me that good of a result.

286
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,660
So that was pretty impressive.

287
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,371
And overall cursor has been super cool to use

288
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:18,740
and is definitely supercharged by productivity.

289
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:21,656
Now with that in mind, I'm only able to use this really

290
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,936
effectively because I already know how to code now.

291
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,100
Sure.

292
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,717
You can use this as a complete beginner with minor experience, but it's going to

293
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:33,180
be significantly harder to actually get anything done because if you do get stuck,

294
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,873
it just really is a little bit of a nightmare to try to

295
00:13:35,897 --> 00:13:38,760
figure out what's going wrong with the AI, fixing the files.

296
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,832
And a lot of times I do find myself having to

297
00:13:40,856 --> 00:13:43,120
dive in there and kind of make the change myself.

298
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,317
Now with that in mind, if you do want to learn how to code or you want to learn

299
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:50,197
even how the LLMs work or get more into data science, machine learning,

300
00:13:50,221 --> 00:13:53,757
kind of all of those interesting and new up and coming fields, I recommend that you

301
00:13:53,781 --> 00:13:56,000
check out the sponsor of today's video, Brilliant.
