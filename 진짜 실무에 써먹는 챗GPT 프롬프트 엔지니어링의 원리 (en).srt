00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,160
Hi, everyone.

2
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,560
I'm Jang PM, and I'm here to show you how to work smarter using AI and no-code tools.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:12,200
Today, we're diving into ChatGPT prompt engineering, which is all about getting better results from ChatGPT.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,580
My goal for this session is to help you create outputs that are not only professional but also full of creative ideas.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:24,020
I want to make sure that the results are polished enough to be directly applied in real-world scenarios.

6
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:30,013
If you've ever felt that ChatGPT's responses are too vague to use in your work,

7
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:34,960
then you’re in the right place. I'll be sharing some practical ideas and examples that you can try.

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,040
I hope this will help you integrate ChatGPT into your daily work.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,620
I've spent time learning from various YouTube videos, lectures, and research papers on prompt engineering.

10
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:51,940
The core concept in this video is based on the 'cognitive prompting' lecture by Kim Chang-jun and Kak Gun-bong.

11
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:58,260
I’ve taken their excellent ideas and teachings and simplified them in my own way to make them easier for you to understand.

12
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,779
I've included links to helpful resources in the video description,

13
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,661
so if you want to delve deeper into the subject, please check them out.

14
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:17,377
Instead of providing job-specific prompt templates or random tips on how to improve prompt performance,

15
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:23,760
I wanted to focus on explaining the fundamental principles behind effective prompt engineering.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So, let's get started right away.

17
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,100
First, let’s look at how ChatGPT works.

18
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:39,640
ChatGPT works by reading all the web documents on the internet and predicting which word is most likely to come next, and it strings words together in this manner.

19
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:48,480
It doesn't actually understand or have the cognitive ability to make responses; it's simply a machine that strings together words through mathematical calculations.

20
00:01:48,481 --> 00:01:54,840
However, its probabilistic calculations are so excellent that it forms sentences and coherent content.

21
00:01:55,160 --> 00:02:01,446
For instance, if you input "I am eating," GPT will calculate which word is most probable to follow

22
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:06,840
and then add the word “a" , "an", or "some" and so on.

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,240
GPT performs these probabilistic calculations within the given context.

24
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,980
If you ask about broad topics, it will give you answers based on the most popular opinions found online.

25
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:21,180
These average opinions are not always the best answers.

26
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,120
If you need professional and creative responses, you need to focus its attention on a specific context.

27
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,600
Because it calculates probabilities in a broad context, you get general answers using common words.

28
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,042
However, when you focus ChatGPT on a specific context,

29
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:43,640
it performs the calculations within that narrow context, which results in more professional answers.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,600
To illustrate, think about political and diplomatic rhetoric.

31
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,200
Why do politicians and diplomats often give vague and general answers?

32
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:01,200
It’s because they have so many factors to consider that they can't express clear opinions and instead speak in general terms.

33
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,280
ChatGPT is the same.

34
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,680
The more context it needs to consider, the more compressed and vague the information becomes.

35
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:15,015
Therefore, when using ChatGPT, you first need to consider whether you want average answers based on a general context,

36
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:19,460
or if you’re looking for professional, more focused answers.

37
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:28,300
If you want professional answers, you need to guide ChatGPT's attention to the specific context you desire,

38
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:35,080
and encourage it to generate professional, creative, and insightful responses within that context.

39
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,440
I've thought of an analogy for this.

40
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:46,440
Think of ChatGPT as a person who has read every book in a vast library of knowledge and gives you an answer based on the information they have.

41
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,840
If you ask a broad question like, "How should we live?"

42
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:53,460
you’ll get a vague and obvious response.

43
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,820
But, we need to consider something.

44
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,300
Is this always bad?

45
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,700
There are situations where getting a broad answer can be more helpful.

46
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:09,820
Sometimes you need a clear answer and sometimes you just want to get a broad scope of information.

47
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,960
Therefore, it’s good to have a strategy for how you will use ChatGPT, and to guide it in that direction.

48
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,360
The important thing is to know what you want, not that it gives answers in this way.

49
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,901
So, how can we get ChatGPT to show the same level of professionalism that a real professional would,

50
00:04:26,902 --> 00:04:31,381
and that is applicable to real-world tasks? How can we use it in this context?

51
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:39,201
If you need marketing help, it would be more useful to get responses based on a marketing book that includes use cases similar to yours,

52
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:45,020
so that you can get more professional and practical ideas.

53
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:53,480
To get professional responses, you need to make ChatGPT open a specific section or a specific book, so to speak.

54
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:57,540
But this is a high-level cognitive ability for knowledge workers.

55
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,220
First, you need to understand exactly what your problem is.

56
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,709
Second, you need to know what kind of expertise you need to solve that problem, and third,

57
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:14,000
you need to be able to evaluate whether the answers ChatGPT provides are good or bad.

58
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,640
So, using ChatGPT requires a high level of metacognition.

59
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,980
In any case, if you want to focus ChatGPT on your specific context, consider these three points.

60
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:33,540
ChatGPT needs to understand the problem you have in the same way that you do, at the same level of understanding.

61
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:42,040
It needs to clearly understand what tasks you need to do, the context, and what constraints to consider.

62
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:46,120
Next, you need to draw out ChatGPT's expertise to solve the problem.

63
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,940
ChatGPT has various expertise, but it's like an expert who doesn't know what they know.

64
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:02,040
Therefore, you need to use prompts that help ChatGPT focus on a specific expert’s context to draw out that expertise.

65
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:09,364
Think about which expert could solve this problem best and what kind of expertise is required.

66
00:06:09,365 --> 00:06:15,740
Include the job title, technical terms, or names of relevant research papers.

67
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:24,460
This will give higher weight to web documents related to that job title, naturally leading to better responses.

68
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:31,790
Also, you need to guide ChatGPT to faithfully imitate how an expert thinks and works,

69
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:37,440
so it can handle the task like an expert.

70
00:06:37,441 --> 00:06:39,920
That's how you draw out expertise.

71
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,760
Finally, you need to guide it to a successful output by providing clear guidance on what a successful outcome should look like,

72
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:56,740
why it would be successful, how it should think, and how it should write, and by giving it successful examples.

73
00:06:56,741 --> 00:07:02,740
ChatGPT will then imitate this method and help you to get a successful result.

74
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,960
So, make sure it understands the problem.

75
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,460
Draw out the expertise.

76
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,020
And guide it to success.

77
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,480
When writing prompts, always consider these three points and try to apply this perspective.

78
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:19,880
It can be difficult to write specific prompts.

79
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:27,340
So, I’ve compiled a list of six elements that you can include in your prompts to make them more specific.

80
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,260
These elements are not from my own research, but I’ve adapted them from a video by Jeff Su, a Google product manager.

81
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:37,660
His video provides a great framework, and I’ll be using it to explain these elements.

82
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,260
If you want to see the original source, check out the link in the description.

83
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,280
Jeff Su says you need to include these six elements in your prompt: command, context, persona, examples, format, and tone.

84
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,120
The elements at the top of this list have a higher priority and are more important.

85
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,560
The elements at the bottom are good to have but less critical.

86
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,280
Let's look at each one.

87
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,900
A command is an action you're asking ChatGPT to do.

88
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:15,020
This includes verbs or phrases like: write, list, organize, summarize. This is the command.

89
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,620
These must be included in your prompts.

90
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,560
You can also have multiple commands in one prompt.

91
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:29,720
You can ask it to identify benefits, summarize them, and then create something new based on that. You can include many tasks in one prompt.

92
00:08:29,721 --> 00:08:39,660
But, if you want a higher quality and detailed response, it's better to use only one verb or command per prompt.

93
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Breaking it down into step-by-step prompts is a much better way to get high quality, professional and detailed responses.

94
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,220
I’ll explain that later.

95
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,020
For now, just remember that a command is a must and one prompt should have only one command.

96
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,220
Next is context.

97
00:08:55,221 --> 00:09:05,640
This involves giving a clear picture of your situation, and informing ChatGPT about what you value most. This will make ChatGPT focus on your context,

98
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:11,440
instead of just giving a generic response. This is what the context element is about.

99
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,160
To make the context more specific, I ask myself these questions:

100
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:28,000
What is my current situation and background? What do I want to achieve with this prompt? What are my concerns when doing this task,

101
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:35,957
and what are the other constraints or rules?

102
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:41,720
By asking yourself these questions and providing clear explanations, you can help ChatGPT focus its attention.

103
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,160
Let me give you an example.

104
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,580
Let's say you're writing a flyer to promote a gym.

105
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,440
You can simply prompt: "Write a flyer to promote a gym.”

106
00:09:53,441 --> 00:09:57,460
But, giving a detailed context will give you a better response.

107
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:05,900
You need to explain what the gym is like and what should be included in the flyer.

108
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:14,940
So, give it the name of the gym, what the gym values most, and specify that this gym focuses on beginners.

109
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:20,308
Rather than offering programs that focus on rapid weight loss or body profiles, which could harm your health,

110
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:25,680
they focus on increasing basal metabolic rate and helping customers restore their health over the long term.

111
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,340
This is a fairly traditional gym.

112
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,980
You need to explain the gym’s characteristics.

113
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:39,900
For the flyer content, I want to target parents for the new school semester in March, and the message should be to “come to the gym after sending the kids to school”.

114
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,440
And offer a discount for PT sessions before 6 PM.

115
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:46,400
Give these specific details as guidance.

116
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,540
Let’s compare the outputs when you do this.

117
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,640
Let's compare these two prompts.

118
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,420
The left prompt writes the flyer, but the content is vague.

119
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,060
At first glance, it looks okay.

120
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,160
But, it also feels generic and soulless.

121
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,300
It lists services and facilities that you’d find in almost any gym.

122
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,740
The promotions are also very generic.

123
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:16,220
It’s not a bad flyer but not useful enough.

124
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,560
Let's provide enough context.

125
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:28,800
As I said, if you explain what you value most and the key message you want to convey in this flyer, it will explain the gym’s unique advantages.

126
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:35,340
It also specifies that this flyer is for the start of the new school semester and gives a discount.

127
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,800
It also lists differentiation points specific to this gym.

128
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:44,260
The copy is also much more tailored to the target customer.

129
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,880
You can see that the output is improved both in terms of form and content.

130
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,140
Next is persona.

131
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:58,400
To focus on more professional aspects, you can have it role-play as a person, role, or job title that is good at solving the problem.

132
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:05,100
The more specific and professional the name, the more technical terms it includes, the more professional the response will be.

133
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:15,800
It's not actually role-playing, but using an expert’s name, technical terms will help it focus on content that is more likely to have professional content,

134
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:22,100
which leads to more professional responses.

135
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:30,480
Many people use persona-based prompts, but they tend to use very general expert titles.

136
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,180
You are a senior marketer.

137
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,840
You are an SEO expert.

138
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:44,822
While this is okay, you can improve the response by using more specific expert titles, and describing their unique advantages.

139
00:12:44,823 --> 00:12:51,380
This will ensure a more professional response and a higher chance of getting useful information.

140
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,840
Let's say you are planning a YouTube video about K-Food.

141
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,280
You can prompt it like this.

142
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:08,160
But, if you think about who is best at making K-Food YouTube content, the YouTuber “Korean Englishman” comes to mind.

143
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,140
So, I didn't specify Korean Englishman, but you could.

144
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,800
I described the person in more detail.

145
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:25,200
He is a YouTuber who introduces Korean food, like chicken, tteokbokki, and toast, which are everyday foods for Koreans, but less well-known around the world. He cooks the foods,

146
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:30,007
has foreigners try them, creates reaction videos, and tells interesting stories about food.

147
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:35,221
He also films foreigners’ lively reactions while eating.

148
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,920
So, that’s a description of the YouTuber.

149
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:46,377
And instead of just asking it to create content from a YouTuber’s perspective, say that this content is sponsored by the Korea Tourism Organization to promote Korean food to foreigners,

150
00:13:46,378 --> 00:13:52,460
and it needs to spark curiosity about Korea.

151
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,780
I gave it a very specific persona and a very specific situation.

152
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,100
Let's see how the two responses differ.

153
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,420
If you compare them, the left response is quite average.

154
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,000
It seems okay, but it feels soulless.

155
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,940
Wine pairings are not bad but I don’t think this will get many views or be very interesting.

156
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,780
A K-Food challenge with a famous celebrity is okay.

157
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,080
But, it's a bit disappointing.

158
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:26,060
It's not bad, but it’s not very innovative, professional, or lively.

159
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,880
It doesn't feel like a real YouTube video.

160
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:35,670
However, with the more specific persona, it suggests a Korean-style chicken experience, testing the spiciness of tteokbokki,

161
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:41,240
introducing Korean toast for breakfast, and having foreigners try kimchi and bibimbap.

162
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:47,960
These are somewhat typical ideas, but the responses are much more lively and specific compared to the one on the left.

163
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:53,900
This shows that a very specific persona leads to more professional and creative answers.

164
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,040
This is what I wanted to point out.

165
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:00,652
And another thing I want to say about personas is that rather than simply using generic personas,

166
00:15:00,653 --> 00:15:06,480
the responses are better when you use lively and detailed ones because the output will be from an expert’s point of view.

167
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:17,760
Here, without a persona, let’s imagine I’m the CEO of a kimbap company, and there is a demand for kimbap in Japan. So I want to create a branch in Japan and try to sell kimbap in the Japanese market. I asked for a business plan.

168
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:22,540
I want you to create a business plan for this.

169
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,820
It will write a business plan for you.

170
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,960
But it's very generic.

171
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,120
But it's very generic.

172
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:32,340
You won't get a business plan that you could use in a real business.

173
00:15:32,341 --> 00:15:39,680
However, if you give it a persona, such as an international business expert, with experience helping companies expand overseas, the output becomes much better.

174
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:46,780
and have experience helping companies expand overseas, then the quality of the response will be much better.

175
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,340
But, you can go even further and provide an even more specific persona.

176
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:59,100
Like in the case of the Korean Englishman, you need to think of a specific person and highlight the advantages and expertise of that person.

177
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,360
And apply that persona to it.

178
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,420
So, this is a CBO, a business leader of a Korean startup and the head of a Japanese subsidiary.

179
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:15,280
He has experience establishing a subsidiary in Japan, and has achieved exponential growth in the Japanese market.

180
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Also, he has experience helping domestic companies expand overseas as a consultant.

181
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,980
I gave it this situation.

182
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,040
Then, I gave it the same prompt.

183
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,360
Let's see how the responses change.

184
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,460
The right output is with a more general persona.

185
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,140
The left output is with a very specific persona.

186
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,220
Looking at the Korean response, the right one is great.

187
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:45,860
It describes the market research required, how to review business strategies, and what the goals and tasks are. It wrote the document like an expert.

188
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:56,020
It also considers regulations, manages supply chains, establishes branches, and it has a plan for continuous improvement and expansion. It's a fairly professional response, but

189
00:16:56,021 --> 00:17:05,860
if you use a very specific persona to draw out more of its expertise, the output becomes much more detailed and professional, both in form and content.

190
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:13,020
I have given a specific situation, and it divided the overall goals and specific tasks, which is one of the differences.

191
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:26,360
Here, it goes beyond simply establishing a legal branch and considers how to create a marketing and branding strategy in the Japanese market, and how to build an effective distribution network

192
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:31,380
and sales to increase distribution.

193
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:37,900
It also gives more detailed answers regarding how to monitor performance and drive growth.

194
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:45,060
The marketing strategy also includes collaborating with local influencers, which is a more innovative and up-to-date response.

195
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,480
Simply providing a specific and lively persona increases the quality of the output.

196
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:51,840
Next is examples.

197
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,880
I highly recommend and emphasize this.

198
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,240
Examples can significantly improve output quality, but many people don’t use them.

199
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,780
Just adding examples will greatly improve your output.

200
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:11,820
A research paper has shown that if the examples are not too long, giving two or more will improve the performance much more than providing just one.

201
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,000
This is called few-shot learning, and giving multiple examples is a better approach.

202
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,620
How do you give examples?

203
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:25,280
If you are using a paid model, such as GPT-4, you can add examples by link or by uploading files.

204
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,280
You can also enter the text within the prompt.

205
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,800
If you are using a free version of ChatGPT, you can't use links or file uploads, so you'll need to enter everything as text.

206
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,760
If you are using the paid version, the file name is very important.

207
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:44,360
If the file name is strange or in Korean, it might not upload properly, or it might not be able to refer to it.

208
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:51,480
So, if you are using a paid model, rename the file to match the content and use English.

209
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,000
This is how you can provide examples.

210
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,220
Providing examples will increase the output quality.

211
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,280
Let's look at this in more detail.

212
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,760
You are a civil litigation expert and you need to write a formal demand letter to a buyer who has failed to pay for the semiconductors they purchased.

213
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,880
You can prompt it like this.

214
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,760
It writes a demand letter.

215
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,520
But, you can include a sample demand letter.

216
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,360
It doesn't have to be a demand letter for your specific situation.

217
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:26,120
But, if you give a sample demand letter that it can imitate, and have it follow that format, it will write it according to the template.

218
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:33,519
So, if your company has a document format and you want the output to match that format, you can use the document as an example,

219
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,880
and the output will follow that format, which makes it much more useful.

220
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,300
The left response is without an example.

221
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,120
The right response includes a sample demand letter as text.

222
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,520
If you're using a free version of ChatGPT, you can enter long text strings like this.

223
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,020
The left response writes the demand letter.

224
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,000
It seems to have a general understanding of what a demand letter is.

225
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:07,380
But, if you provide an example, it will divide it into sender and recipient, and include phrases like "I hope the recipient flourishes", that are often used in demand letters.

226
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,700
It will imitate it.

227
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:12,660
So, it will use the sender and recipient format, and add phrases like "I wish you success in your business".

228
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:20,380
It will use the correct demand letter format, mention the contract, what the issues are, and what action needs to be taken,

229
00:20:20,381 --> 00:20:27,680
and it will write in the style of a demand letter.

230
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:33,320
By providing examples, you can get output that is much more applicable for real-world use.

231
00:20:33,321 --> 00:20:36,300
In addition to mimicking the form,

232
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:42,220
it will also mimic the tone, content structure, delivery method, and style.

233
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:53,600
When creating reports or results, you can use a sample case that shows the tone that should be used in the report,

234
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,160
Let's say you are writing a PR document.

235
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,300
So, I entered the persona, asked it to write a PR document, and asked it what the PR document should be about, how long it should be, and in what format it should be written.

236
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,020
I used a specific prompt like this.

237
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,580
And then, I added an example to the prompt.

238
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:18,717
If I include an example of a good PR document, it will use this example as a guide for its tone,

239
00:21:18,718 --> 00:21:24,320
content structure, and choice of words, and produce a draft that is much closer to the example.

240
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,840
The left response is without an example.

241
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,920
This is not a bad press release.

242
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,560
The content structure is interesting.

243
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:33,820
It explains the content of the service.

244
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,813
But, if I include a good example of a press release and have it imitate the content structure,

245
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:43,100
it will write the press release according to this style and it will look more like a Korean style press release.

246
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:49,989
It summarizes the key points in two, explains the launch of the product, and concludes with a related interview, which is a typical Korean press release style.

247
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:55,180
So, it will imitate the typical format of a Korean press release.

248
00:21:55,181 --> 00:22:02,041
So, it will summarize the key points, explain what it is about, and then provide the key points.

249
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:07,200
It will then explain what is unique about it and conclude with a related interview.

250
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:18,260
By providing examples of similar documents from competitors or similar previous documents from your company, it will imitate them and write a document that meets your needs.

251
00:22:18,261 --> 00:22:25,160
So you can see that providing examples can help you get an output tailored to your needs.

252
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,516
The next element is format. When we give instructions for a task, we usually specify the format.

253
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:36,661
We give specific instructions on how we want the task done, and we expect the task to be done according to those instructions.

254
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,940
However, it often does not follow those instructions.

255
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:46,384
But, if you provide examples of good responses and bad responses, it will understand the instructions more accurately,

256
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:51,520
and avoid giving responses that violate the instructions.

257
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,160
In this example, let’s say it’s translating between Korean and English.

258
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,860
So, I created a translation task.

259
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:06,320
I asked it to act as a professional Korean-English translator and translate Korean to English word-for-word. I also told it not to respond to the prompt, and only output the translated result.

260
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,780
And here is where I use examples.

261
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:16,460
I included an example: "안녕하세요" should be translated to "hello", and it's wrong to respond "반갑습니다 무엇을 도와드릴까요".

262
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,427
And, if I enter "오늘 날씨 어때요", the correct response should be "What's the weather like today",

263
00:23:20,428 --> 00:23:24,820
and it's wrong to respond to that.

264
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,600
I gave these examples using a few-shot approach.

265
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:34,480
By providing these examples, it will understand the instructions much more accurately and follow them much more effectively.

266
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,820
The left side is only the instructions without examples.

267
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:42,960
When you make a request, it seems to handle it quite well at first glance.

268
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,040
But, I made a request that was a bit tricky, like a prompt.

269
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:57,540
It should have responded with a direct translation, but instead it wrote a detailed response, as if it was ChatGPT answering this question.

270
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:03,080
It can fail to follow instructions and go in the wrong direction.

271
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:12,700
However, when I use two or more examples that explain how to follow the instructions correctly, it responds much more accurately.

272
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,460
It translates simple text correctly.

273
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:21,400
And when I input a prompt, instead of responding to the prompt, it simply translates it.

274
00:24:21,401 --> 00:24:30,420
So, ChatGPT sometimes does not follow instructions or guidance and gives answers as it pleases. This tendency is more prominent in the free version of ChatGPT,

275
00:24:30,421 --> 00:24:35,860
but providing more detailed instructions using examples will help it follow them much better.

276
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:44,300
Next is the format. Specifying the output format will make the response match the format.

277
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:55,360
If you specify whether the output should be a table or text, and if text, if you want bullet points or markdown format, specifying the desired format

278
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:03,120
or the length, such as thousand words or two thousand words, it will generate text that matches your criteria.

279
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,991
In addition to specifying the length and format, if you provide an outline of how the content should be structured,

280
00:25:08,992 --> 00:25:13,961
it will add content that follows that outline.

281
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,220
This can help you get the output you want.

282
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:27,560
Therefore, when you are writing your presentation, you should consider your kernels, and your presentation, but if you are presenting to a family the situation will be different.

283
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:53,600
Anyway, when you are providing the content, be careful about the kernels, and if you check the output, you can see that it follows the format I specified such as the subject, expected effects, outline, and time allocation.

284
00:25:53,601 --> 00:25:57,920
It includes the topic, expected benefits, outline, and time allocation, as requested.

285
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,600
When I asked for a timetable in table format, it did it in table format.

286
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,760
When you format your prompts, it is best to use markdown format.

287
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:17,400
You can specify the main title and the sub-content with bullets, etc. ChatGPT understands this markdown format,

288
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:26,960
so, it is a good format for specifying the format of text. Here, when I asked for a business plan, I specified how the plan should be structured,

289
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:31,748
and it provided the service plan, target customer,

290
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:36,221
target market, key features, and differentiation strategy, and it did that for me.

291
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,600
Finally, there is tone.

292
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:44,120
If you specify adjectives like "concise", "friendly", or "kind", it will generally write it in that tone.

293
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:44,440
That is what it does.

294
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:54,640
For tone, I don't use it when I'm looking at the output myself, but I tend to use it when the writing will be shown to someone outside of the company or to customers.

295
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:00,640
Adjusting the tone can make your output seem much more refined.

296
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:06,800
And when it’s hard to explain with adjectives, I provide specific examples to make it imitate the tone.

297
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:18,180
UX writing is about writing from a customer's point of view to make apps and websites easier to use. I provided a good UX writing example and asked it to rewrite the content using UX writing techniques.

298
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:26,800
I want you to rewrite this content using UX writing techniques based on examples of successful UX writing.

299
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:32,980
For example, instead of “Don’t show today,” I used “See again tomorrow” to make it more positive. Instead of “product details,” I used “product description” to use terminology relevant to the service. I used Korean instead of English.

300
00:27:32,981 --> 00:27:40,160
I added the example to show how it should use Korean terminology rather than English.

301
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:46,316
You can just provide examples, but if you explain why they are good,

302
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:52,900
it will be better because it will write the output according to your priorities.

303
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,000
And adding a lot of content to a ChatGPT prompt does not always improve it.

304
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:05,820
If you pick a few good examples and explain why they are good, you can get good results with fewer examples.

305
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,620
I will explain this in more detail later.

306
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:15,500
The prompt says: rewrite the text using UX writing techniques based on the examples I provided.

307
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:22,100
I explained why the examples are good and how the examples should be used to perform UX writing.

308
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,540
And I asked it to rewrite the given text.

309
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:30,904
So, instead of saying “If you leave this page, your content will not be saved”, it used more encouraging

310
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:36,480
and positive expressions and phrases to encourage user action.

311
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,200
It gave a phrase that means: “If you leave, your work will disappear.”

312
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:39,920
Is it okay?

313
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,380
This is a great phrase.

314
00:28:41,381 --> 00:28:47,420
It gives a few suggestions and asks you to choose one, which can be applied to your work.

315
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,860
What do you think?

316
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:54,633
I have explained the six elements of specific prompt writing sequentially and provided examples of how outputs improve when those elements are included.

317
00:28:54,634 --> 00:28:59,220
I don’t know if you were able to understand how these elements can be used to produce a better output.

318
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:06,210
When writing prompts, remember these elements and try to include them as much as possible.

319
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:11,360
This will help you produce better outputs.

320
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,440
This is the key message that I wanted to share with you.

321
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,000
I hope these tips will be helpful when writing your prompts.

322
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,820
I’ve finished my main points, but I want to bring up some discussion topics regarding prompts.

323
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,440
There's no single right answer for writing prompts.

324
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,580
It’s something you need to train and practice.

325
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:36,420
Considering the discussion points I’m about to share will definitely improve your prompt writing skills.

326
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:41,360
Think about the discussion points first and then look at my opinion.

327
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:46,380
Feel free to discuss or debate with my ideas and add your own.

328
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,860
If you leave a comment, this video will be a much richer learning resource.

329
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,380
The core principle is,

330
00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:01,180
how do you guide ChatGPT's attention to a certain context and expertise to get better responses?

331
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,580
Think about this point when leaving comments.

332
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,640
The first discussion point is: is it better to use Korean or English prompts?

333
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:11,360
Generally, people say that English prompts give better responses.

334
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:12,361
And this is true.

335
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,400
It is true.

336
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,900
But, why is that?

337
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:18,020
Are English prompts always better in every situation?

338
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,400
Think about that.

339
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,080
English prompts generally give longer and more professional responses.

340
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,840
The reason it generates longer content is because English is more token-efficient.

341
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,900
So, when you use English, it can use fewer tokens compared to Korean when using the same content.

342
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,100
Therefore, the response can be longer.

343
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,940
And because it is longer, it can provide more detailed responses.

344
00:30:37,941 --> 00:30:42,280
But, this is not the only reason why English prompts give better responses.

345
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,000
There is far more professional knowledge available in English.

346
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:56,821
So, when users use English, it has better access to professional content, which means that it is considering that context and providing more professional answers.

347
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:04,320
So, it is true that English is better when you want to generate professional and creative text.

348
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:12,480
However, for marketing writing or situations specific to Korea, where the unique qualities of Korean are important, Korean prompts can be better.

349
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:20,840
When you use Korean, more weight is given to Korean web documents, which leads to responses that are better suited to the Korean situation.

350
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:25,040
So, I created prompts that make copy for a virtual brand.

351
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,780
I compared prompts in English that are then translated with prompts in Korean.

352
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:36,820
The left is a direct Korean prompt and the right is the result of translating a response from an English prompt.

353
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:43,060
You can see that Korean-style marketing copy is better when using a Korean prompt.

354
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:54,180
So, for the yogurt copy, things like "Filled with Texture" and "A New Standard" are common expressions used in Korean marketing and they are quite familiar to us.

355
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,720
This is because the responses are given in a Korean context.

356
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,140
However, if you use English,

357
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:05,900
the professionalism might increase, but in situations where you need to maintain a Korean style and tone, it is often less suitable.

358
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,800
“Savor App”.

359
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,400
Every spoonful is a very awkward expression in Korean.

360
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,220
It is very awkward in Korean.

361
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,240
And the phrase "Feel the natural beat" is not commonly used in Korean.

362
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,400
This is not something that Koreans say.

363
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,180
What is it called, a rhyme?

364
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:27,820
The expressions that focus on that type of thing are not necessary in Korean, and they are more of the copywriting style preferred by people in the US.

365
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,860
So, if you need a Korean context, Korean prompts are better.

366
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:38,083
When writing YouTube titles, planning YouTube content, using Korean YouTube videos as references

367
00:32:38,084 --> 00:32:44,140
will probably be better than using English prompts to reference English YouTubers.

368
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:51,281
So, you should consider whether the situation you are in needs to have a Korean context or whether you need content that focuses on professionalism,

369
00:32:51,282 --> 00:32:56,400
and then determine whether you should use Korean or English prompts.

370
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:03,760
Second, people usually use ChatGPT with the role of humans asking and ChatGPT answering.

371
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,020
Is that always the case?

372
00:33:05,021 --> 00:33:18,060
As I've said in previous videos, when using AI as a tool, instead of thinking of yourself as the one giving orders and the AI as the one just providing the result, it's better to think of AI and humans as collaborating,

373
00:33:18,061 --> 00:33:23,160
working together to improve the quality of the output.

374
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:27,420
You should have this perspective when writing prompts.

375
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:34,060
So, ask ChatGPT what you can do to improve your prompts.

376
00:33:34,061 --> 00:33:40,260
I mentioned that it's good to use professional terms or specific names of experts to focus it on a specific context.

377
00:33:40,261 --> 00:33:45,740
So ask it, "Which expert do you think would solve this problem best?"

378
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,820
Ask it like that.

379
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,940
This can give you a hint regarding who the expert should be.

380
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:58,500
And you need to give detailed information regarding your situation. Don’t just explain it and have it generate a response, but instead ask what information you should give to improve the response

381
00:33:58,501 --> 00:34:04,040
and better help it understand your situation.

382
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:12,008
After providing the explanation, have it evaluate how clear and well-organized your explanation is.

383
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:18,621
Ask it to give a score and provide suggestions on what you can do to improve it.

384
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,500
You can have it evaluate your output.

385
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:30,000
So, instead of just having ChatGPT answer your questions, collaborate with it to improve the prompts, and get better results.

386
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,620
So, instead of just saying "create ad copy for an offline workshop,"

387
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,620
"write two lines of copy and give suggestions."

388
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,020
It will write copy for you.

389
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,100
And it's not a bad idea to choose one from the suggestions.

390
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:52,480
But, it’s much better to ask which expert with what expertise or experience would be most suitable for performing this mission to find the persona.

391
00:34:52,900 --> 00:35:00,660
"An ad copywriter who has experience writing content in the AI field. Create ad copy from that perspective."

392
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:05,320
You can derive an expert and use that expertise as the persona.

393
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:09,260
Then, ask: "What information do you need to improve this answer?"

394
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,560
"What additional information do you need?"

395
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:17,678
If you ask this question, it will ask for information like what the goal of the workshop is, who will attend, what kind of format it will be,

396
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:23,040
and what differentiates it from other workshops. ChatGPT will ask you for information to improve its response.

397
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:32,880
And by providing it with that information, you can help ChatGPT to understand the context and give an answer that matches your needs.

398
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,953
So, you should collaborate with ChatGPT and engage in mutual questions and answers to improve your prompts,

399
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:44,100
and thirdly, I've emphasized the importance of specific prompts.

400
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,040
But, we need to consider if it's always better to use specific prompts.

401
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,860
When you are very specific, ChatGPT will focus on that specific situation.

402
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Is that always good?

403
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:02,950
First, if there's too much input, ChatGPT might focus on too many things and lose focus.

404
00:36:02,951 --> 00:36:08,380
It could also focus on things that you didn't think were as important as they are,

405
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:12,780
which means it may not go in the direction you want.

406
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:23,700
One of the situations where I experience this most is when I provide examples or reference data. If the reference data is too large, it will forget the key requirements it needs to reflect

407
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:31,740
and focus too much on the examples or reference data, and the response may go in the wrong direction.

408
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:33,840
For example, like this.

409
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,180
This is one of my YouTube videos and I wanted to improve the title and thumbnail.

410
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:51,500
So, I took the titles of a popular YouTuber called Kim Jakka TV, gave them to ChatGPT, and asked it to identify the characteristics and improve the title of my video.

411
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,820
The left prompt gave the full script of my video.

412
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,120
The right prompt only gave the key points that I wanted to be included in the title, and it improved the title and applied it to my channel.

413
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,320
Let's see how the responses differ.

414
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,600
I asked it to take the most popular titles of Kim Jakka TV and analyze them.

415
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:19,480
Based on the analysis, I asked it to identify the techniques that the YouTuber used to drive views.

416
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,140
I wanted it to use these techniques to rewrite the title of my video.

417
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,480
You can see that I’m using the persona of an editor to write the title.

418
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,720
And to use concise language for my video.

419
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:34,680
And that it's important to use a provocative title to drive curiosity.

420
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:43,080
So, I asked it to use the title style of the videos mentioned above, and rewrite the title based on the content in the script below.

421
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,660
I then provided the full script of my video, which took up a large portion of the prompt.

422
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,820
So, ChatGPT focused a lot of its attention on understanding and summarizing the content of the video.

423
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:01,620
It did provide titles based on the content.

424
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:10,200
But, the key point for me was to create a YouTube title that people would click, not to summarize the content.

425
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:20,120
So, while these titles are not bad, they don't capture the strengths of Kim Jakka TV, and they're not the kind of titles that would grab attention.

426
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:28,061
But, if I pick a very specific example from Kim Jakka TV and tell it to imitate it, and focus on a smaller range of things to imitate,

427
00:38:28,062 --> 00:38:34,680
and instead of giving the full script, if I only give the key points,

428
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:44,628
it will focus on those points and those examples, so you can see that the title is more in line with what I wanted and more attention-grabbing, like the titles of Kim Jakka TV.

429
00:38:44,629 --> 00:38:51,140
It will make a title that is closer to what I wanted, and it would be more attention-grabbing, like Kim Jakka TV’s titles.

430
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,420
This shows that giving too much content in your prompts is not always better.

431
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,700
So, when I asked it to write a PR document, I provided the entire PR document.

432
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:12,640
The previous example was okay, because the content was related, and ChatGPT was able to stay focused. But if I give it a completely irrelevant PR document as a reference,

433
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:19,808
and have it imitate that whole thing, it will focus its attention on that content,

434
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:26,500
which can lead to content that is mixed up or a press release that is completely off the mark.

435
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:34,848
So, it is important to think about how you can ensure that ChatGPT’s attention is focused on what is important and that giving too much content in your prompts can lead to undesirable outcomes.

436
00:39:34,849 --> 00:39:42,400
So, you should think about how you can make ChatGPT’s attention focused on what you want it to, and avoid giving it too much content.

437
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:51,940
When you train and give resources to ChatGPT, people think that if they give it enough information, it will understand everything like a human, but

438
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:58,505
ChatGPT doesn’t work like that. Instead, it focuses on certain parts of the prompt, and the responses are created based on that,

439
00:39:58,506 --> 00:40:04,920
so, if you provide too much data, the results may not be what you want.

440
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,420
Here's another situation where a specific prompt is not always better.

441
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:14,020
Not all problems require specific and professional contexts.

442
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:26,580
For example: summarizing, extracting patterns from the source, and converting from type A to type B format, or converting a blog post into a YouTube interview script, and identifying relationships between two unstructured data points.

443
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:35,340
To make it easier, this is like the Korean SAT test.

444
00:40:35,341 --> 00:40:36,341
It’s called the Korean Language section.

445
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,140
There are situations on the test where you’re given a passage and you have to answer questions based on that passage.

446
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:47,000
You don't need a very specific prompt in those types of situations.

447
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:51,600
You don’t need to say "You’re a very good summarizer."

448
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,440
Summarizing is a skill that it has.

449
00:40:54,441 --> 00:40:59,100
It can handle the task well with its language ability alone, so it’s better to use simple prompts.

450
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:08,760
So, tasks like extracting delivery information from reviews, categorizing reviews as positive, neutral or negative, extracting only company names from resumes.

451
00:41:08,761 --> 00:41:18,000
These types of tasks, like those on the Korean Language section of the SAT, where there is a clear answer, and do not require specific domain knowledge, and where its language skills alone are enough to solve the task,

452
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:23,500
it's better to use simple prompts instead of more specific ones.

453
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:29,000
People want to template good prompts and reuse them.

454
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,480
I understand that desire.

455
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:33,980
But, is it better to use a completed prompt template?

456
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,540
I think it’s better to use a step-by-step prompt.

457
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,960
This is because ChatGPT is supposed to imitate how an expert works, and experts don’t create a final product right away.

458
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:50,500
We need to have ChatGPT imitate an expert’s work process, so it needs to work in a step-by-step process.

459
00:41:50,780 --> 00:42:01,980
When you are trying to make ChatGPT work step-by-step, instead of putting all the steps into one prompt and having it do all that at once, it's better to break the tasks down

460
00:42:01,981 --> 00:42:09,240
and give it one task at a time, improving the response through conversations. This gives better results.

461
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:16,320
There are also prompt techniques for step-by-step tasks such as “Let's Think Step by Step”.

462
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:27,800
This is better than not having it, because it follows the steps you specified and processes it step-by-step. So, using this is better than having it work as one whole process.

463
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:32,260
But, even better than “Let's Think Step by Step” is to break down the tasks and request it one by one,

464
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:37,558
and improve the responses over time. This is an even better approach to a step-by-step prompt.

465
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,000
and improve the responses gradually. I think that is even better for a step-by-step prompt.

466
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:48,080
Let's say you are a recruiter on LinkedIn and you want to send DMs to candidates.

467
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:53,560
So, explain your company and invite them for an informal coffee chat.

468
00:42:53,561 --> 00:43:00,380
I provided all the steps needed to write the recruitment message, and I asked it to generate a response based on those steps.

469
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:06,300
The left side has all the steps in one prompt, so it gives the result in one shot.

470
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:13,600
The right side has the steps broken down into separate tasks, and uses a step-by-step approach to create the response.

471
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:19,220
This results in a much more natural and smooth output.

472
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:24,660
The recruitment message on the left isn't bad, but it feels a bit stiff.

473
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:33,840
But, the recruitment DM on the right is much closer to a real LinkedIn DM and it was more suitable for the situation of inviting candidates for a casual coffee chat.

474
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:44,760
To do this, you have to break it down into tasks, derive advantages, revise advantages into catchy headlines, and create a message based on the headlines and

475
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:50,275
provide consideration points. This makes it easy for you to see each step and provide feedback on each one.

476
00:43:50,276 --> 00:43:54,640
It also has the advantage of giving feedback during each step.

477
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:01,754
Also, instead of using one prompt that has too much content and doesn't focus on the appropriate aspects,

478
00:44:01,755 --> 00:44:06,800
it gets much better results when you focus on one task at a time.

479
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,920
So, I recommend using intermediate steps when writing prompts.

480
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,480
In conclusion, prompt engineering seems to come down to these two things.

481
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:20,960
I think this is the key point. To do your job well, what do you need to do?

482
00:44:20,961 --> 00:44:27,786
What mindset, what metacognitive skills do you need to have to produce successful results?

483
00:44:27,787 --> 00:44:33,561
A person who has this skill and can articulate it in language is good at prompt engineering.

484
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:42,300
People who have experience and have thought deeply about their work, and who know how to succeed and fail, and who have metacognition,

485
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:45,980
can use that metacognition, articulate it in language, and get better results from ChatGPT.

486
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:56,580
You also need to fine-tune it. Don't expect results just because you have the metacognition and can write it as a prompt. You need to guide ChatGPT to focus on the expertise you want and generate the output you want.

487
00:44:56,581 --> 00:45:02,660
You need to guide ChatGPT to focus on the expertise you want and generate the output you want.

488
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:07,180
If you do these two things, you’ll get the results you want from ChatGPT.

489
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:13,647
Finally, let me show you the process of how I used ChatGPT to write a blog post,

490
00:45:13,648 --> 00:45:17,820
so you can see how all these tips come together.

491
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:24,997
When I used ChatGPT to create a blog post automatically before, I just provided the title and asked an SEO expert to write a blog post,

492
00:45:24,998 --> 00:45:31,580
which resulted in a soulless piece of writing.

493
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:42,840
But, if you focus on drawing out the expertise, providing your own context, and providing a benchmark of what you want, and have it imitate that,

494
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:48,700
you can get reasonably good results from ChatGPT.

495
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:59,240
I don't think ChatGPT is an all-powerful tool, but I also don’t think it is not capable of creating practical results.

496
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:06,760
I think that, depending on the way that you work with it, you can produce real and practical results, and I want to emphasize this point.

497
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,860
Let’s look at the blog writing process.

498
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:16,000
I explain my context and then ask which expert would be the best to handle this mission.

499
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:23,820
So, I’m drawing out expertise and using that to produce output with ChatGPT.

500
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:28,780
Instead of going straight to the final piece, I first have it produce an intermediate result.

501
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,360
What is an intermediate result in writing?

502
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,700
That would be the outline.

503
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:42,972
So, after giving it a specific persona and describing the specific expertise of the persona, and after providing my context,

504
00:46:42,973 --> 00:46:49,880
I ask it a question about the topic: "What should a solopreneur choose between a niche and a mass market?"

505
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,920
Then I asked it to write an outline for the blog post.

506
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:58,440
Based on that, it will create an outline.

507
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:08,080
And to improve that outline, I asked it what additional information I need to provide. I told it that I want to make this outline unique and differentiated.

508
00:47:08,081 --> 00:47:14,926
And it asked for more real world success cases, data, and things to think about.

509
00:47:14,927 --> 00:47:20,360
So, it asked for real world successful cases, data, and aspects to think about.

510
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,540
And then, I give it feedback by giving it the information that I have available.

511
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,600
This will help to further develop the context.

512
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:34,160
Based on that, it will write a new outline and I will provide feedback like a supervisor.

513
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:40,740
I ask it to remove sections 5 and 6, and ask it to expand on section 4.

514
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:42,780
And then it’s time to write.

515
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,380
When writing, you can use the outline and have it write the whole thing.

516
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:53,580
Or you can have it write each section separately and put them together. This will give a better result.

517
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,500
It will also be longer.

518
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,500
So, by breaking it down into steps, you can have it write your blog post.

519
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,220
So, when I translate the text to Korean, the content is great.

520
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,940
But, the Korean is awkward.

521
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:15,000
This is because I used an English prompt to draw out more of the content-related professionalism, which means the writing is better suited for an English blog post.

522
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:25,680
So, if I provide an example of one of my previous blog posts, and have it imitate that, the writing becomes much more natural and similar to what I would write.

523
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:32,072
By using this method, instead of just giving a title and asking it to write, by drawing out the expertise and having it imitate the expert’s methods,

524
00:48:32,073 --> 00:48:38,200
and break down the tasks step by step, you get a much more professional and well-written output.

525
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:48,040
To make the writing more unique, I asked it what additional information I needed to give, and it asked me to tell my personal success story.

526
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:55,340
So, I told it about my success story, and the journey I went through when creating my no-code YouTube channel, and it wrote this.

527
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:58,740
It is much more unique, and includes details about my experience.

528
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:05,140
I gave an example of a Korean blog post and asked it to rewrite in Korean, so the writing style has now become more natural.

529
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:11,160
This shows you how you can use ChatGPT to improve your output.

530
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,040
So, if you want to write good prompts,

531
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:20,407
you first need to think about your goals and what you want to achieve with ChatGPT,

532
00:49:20,408 --> 00:49:25,980
and you need to think about the specific context of the problem you are trying to solve, and articulate it in language.

533
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:34,200
To do this, you have to imitate an expert, which means you need to articulate in language what expertise is needed, and how an expert would go about this task.

534
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:42,260
You also need to guide it to imitate that, and be able to assess the results, and know what is good, bad, what can be improved,

535
00:49:42,261 --> 00:49:50,000
and then improve it through multiple iterations of the prompt. This is how you write a good prompt and get better results.

536
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:58,540
You might think that this is too much work, but working with ChatGPT will help you to improve your metacognitive abilities, and using well-structured prompts based on those skills,

537
00:49:58,541 --> 00:50:03,938
will increase your level of competence in your work,

538
00:50:03,939 --> 00:50:08,460
and definitely improve your productivity.

539
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:13,560
Isn't all this similar to how humans work and communicate effectively?

540
00:50:13,561 --> 00:50:22,720
The skill of writing good ChatGPT prompts is simply about articulating in language how humans work and then having it imitate that.

541
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,511
So, if you know how you can do your work well and you have that metacognition, and you have the patience to

542
00:50:28,512 --> 00:50:33,260
communicate well with ChatGPT, you can write good ChatGPT prompts.

543
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,540
So, I don't think of ChatGPT as an all-powerful magic key.

544
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,420
I think of it more as a work partner.

545
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:51,200
And as a human, I feel that my expertise, domain knowledge, liberal arts, intuition, and insight,

546
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,080
are becoming more important for guiding ChatGPT.

547
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,280
When I had this conversation with the machine, I didn't write a single line of code.

548
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,380
And I didn't use any new techniques when talking with this machine.

549
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:10,340
If you think of it as a person and do your best, you can have a much better experience using ChatGPT.

550
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,540
In some ways, I think liberal arts skills are becoming more important.

551
00:51:13,541 --> 00:51:20,580
I'm not saying that people who specialize in the liberal arts are better, but I do believe those types of skills are becoming more important.

552
00:51:20,581 --> 00:51:26,226
So, I think that people with problem-solving skills, rather than those with deep technical knowledge,

553
00:51:26,227 --> 00:51:30,900
will be the ones who can be successful in the age of AI.

554
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:37,800
By combining your human skills with AI, you can become a real "in-demand" talent in the age of AI.

555
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,500
That’s what this is all about.

556
