00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,920
Hello and welcome to the first
video of the beginner course for n8n.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,268
In this course, we will be
covering all of the basics

3
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:11,260
that you need to know
to get started with n8n.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:15,560
In this video, we'll be covering
an introduction to automation.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,540
My name is Maxime and I'm a
marketing and data content creator

6
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:25,620
as well as instructor for Le
Wagon, a French training company.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,600
I've been working with n8n for over four
years now, built over 100 workflows and

8
00:00:32,601 --> 00:00:37,700
trained 500 students at improving
their marketing and data automation.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,240
Today, we're going to be talking
about an introduction to automation.

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,220
Why do we need automation?

11
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,800
What is it?

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,440
What are the core concepts?

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,000
What is a workflow?

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,480
As well as some best
practices to help you get started.

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,700
n8n First of all, why
do we need automation?

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,200
The whole reason we need automation
is to make data driven decisions.

17
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,792
When we take decisions
based on feeling or

18
00:01:05,793 --> 00:01:08,801
intuition, it is subject
to interpretation.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,840
It is subjective.

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:16,960
This makes it difficult to estimate and
justify the return on investment and often

21
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:21,400
incurs wasted resources, whether
they be budgetary or time related.

22
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,829
However, n8n When we
take a data-driven approach,

23
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,860
this makes it much more
logic-driven and objective.

24
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,640
It'll improve your capacity to report
and increase your visibility on ROI,

25
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:42,921
as well as requiring fewer resources, human
resources, budgetary, and in terms of time.

26
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,720
Automation is the key
to being data-driven.

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:52,180
When tasks are executed manually,
we have a lot of wasted time, we have

28
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:55,559
human error from
repeated low-value tasks,

29
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,941
as well as high human
resource requirements.

30
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:03,140
This leads to low employee
happiness and retention.

31
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,621
No one is happy to be
doing low-value tasks, for

32
00:02:07,622 --> 00:02:11,100
example, copying data from
one spreadsheet to another.

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,140
However, when we start to integrate
automation, we gain much more

34
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:21,260
predictability and data availability,
increased employee efficiency,

35
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,300
because each employee can now focus
their efforts on much higher-value tasks.

36
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,760
This leads to higher ROI and
lower needs for human resources.

37
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,240
So, what is automation?

38
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,940
Let's start with the definition.

39
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,877
Automation is a predictable
set of predetermined

40
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,700
actions that transfers data
from one point to another.

41
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,220
This is a very wordy definition.

42
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,594
Instead of breaking
down all the parameters of

43
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:57,900
automation, Here we can
see an example of a workflow.

44
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,540
So, we have a form submission.

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,840
When the form is submitted, we check what
kind of company is submitting the form.

46
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,540
If we cannot find a
company, we ignore.

47
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,148
If it's a low-value
company, we can add the

48
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:18,300
person submitting the
form to an email sequence.

49
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,860
If it's a high-value company, we can
add the information to a Google Sheet.

50
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,858
And if it's an ideal
customer, then we can give

51
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:30,540
this information to an
account manager ASAP.

52
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,740
So, as you can see here, we have a
predictable set of predetermined actions.

53
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,800
Depending on which kind of company
is submitting the form, we have a very

54
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:48,000
predictable set of actions
that need to be executed.

55
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:52,780
And we have a data transfer
from one point to another.

56
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,080
The starting point being
the form submission.

57
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,020
And depending on what kind of company
is submitting the form, we're going to be

58
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:05,298
transferring the data to
either an email tool, a Google

59
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:09,020
Sheets, or, for example, Slack
to notify the account manager.

60
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,040
As you can imagine, if we do not have a
predictable set of predetermined actions,

61
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,730
and depending on the kind
of company, we weren't able

62
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:23,280
to say, if it's this kind
of company, we do this.

63
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,100
If it's that kind of
company, we do that.

64
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,157
Then we wouldn't be able to
create an automation because

65
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:31,200
we would have to have some
kind of human intervention.

66
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,620
Again, if we do not have any data transfer,
then we're not really automating anything.

67
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,780
So the data transfer
explains itself.

68
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,640
I'd like to cover some core
concepts of automation.

69
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,900
There are important to understand
before building your first workflows.

70
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,780
The first thing I'd like
to talk about is a trigger.

71
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,900
A trigger is what
starts an automation.

72
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,835
So from the example that
we looked at earlier, we

73
00:04:58,836 --> 00:05:01,740
can see that the trigger
was the form submission.

74
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,400
When we're going to be drawing out these
automations, we're going to see that the

75
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:10,200
trigger is not going to have an
entry arrow, only an exit arrow.

76
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,080
There are many
different kinds of triggers.

77
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,520
A trigger can be manual,
so executed manually.

78
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,460
It can be scheduled, so every minute, every
day at 8 A.M., once a month at 4 p .m.

79
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,880
Or it can be linked
to applications.

80
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,640
We can trigger workflow when we receive a
webhook, when a property is updated in the

81
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:34,540
CRM, or when, for
example, a form is submitted.

82
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:44,540
Under the form submission block,
you can see an example of an N8n node.

83
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,900
Here the N8n form trigger.

84
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,455
This allows you to trigger
a workflow when a form

85
00:05:51,456 --> 00:05:55,301
is submitted using the
native N8n form trigger.

86
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,940
Then we have filtering.

87
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,000
Filtering is what allows us to allow or
block certain types of data from following

88
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:07,100
specific paths based
on certain conditions.

89
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,160
So using the example from earlier,
here we can see depending on the kind of

90
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:18,440
company, whether there is no company,
a low value company, high value company,

91
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,031
or if the company is an
ideal customer, we're going

92
00:06:23,032 --> 00:06:26,080
to be sending that company
down different paths.

93
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,580
Underneath you can
see the filter node in N8n.

94
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:34,352
The filter node allows you
to, as its name indicates,

95
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:37,540
filter data based on
predetermined conditions.

96
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,420
So here, for example, we could say if we
had no company, then we wouldn't continue

97
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,120
the workflow because there is
nothing to do if we have no company.

98
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:54,160
Another important thing to
understand is actions or apps.

99
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,440
Actions allow you to interact
with applications on the web.

100
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,720
This is what you're going to be using
most of the time when building automation.

101
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,780
We can take a
couple of examples.

102
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,379
So with Google Sheets,
you might want to update

103
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,420
rows, create a sheet
or get a spreadsheet.

104
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:17,200
If you're using Dropbox, you can
upload a file, get a file, create a folder,

105
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,020
move a file from
one folder to another.

106
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,820
If we're using Slack, you can send a
message, get a message, get a user,

107
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,160
get all of the messages
from a specific channel.

108
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,740
If we're using Salesforce, which is a
CRM, we can get a company, get a contact,

109
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,260
create a lead, associate
a lead to a company.

110
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,900
This is going to depend highly on
which kinds of apps you're using.

111
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:47,320
Every app is going to have a different
set of actions that you can use for it.

112
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,340
So what is a workflow?

113
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,960
We looked at the example earlier with the
form submission, then the different paths

114
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:00,760
depending on the kind of
company, and then different actions.

115
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,540
Most workflows are going
to follow a similar template.

116
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,100
They're going to
start with a trigger.

117
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,900
So the trigger is what starts
or launches the workflow.

118
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:18,660
It could be every day at 8am, or when
this happens, or when launched manually.

119
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,000
Then we're going to be either sorting,
filtering, formatting, transforming,

120
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,820
or segmenting the data.

121
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:35,980
So this could be if this, then that, only
if this, then that, or change this to that.

122
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:40,860
This is when we're going to be able
to look at all of the filters, filters that

123
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:47,360
we created earlier, or make modifications
to the data, to then send to the actions,

124
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,900
which are going to be usually
the last parts of your workflow.

125
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,820
Either updating, for example, a Google
Sheet, sending an email, or notifying a

126
00:08:57,821 --> 00:09:00,340
person, let's say,
through a Slack message.

127
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,460
I'd like to quickly cover some
automation best practices.

128
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,420
Before starting any automation, you need
to make sure that you are mapping it out.

129
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,580
So when someone is going to come to
you and ask, I would like to automate this

130
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:21,040
task, or if you have an idea, I
would like to automate this task.

131
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,120
The first step that you're
going to want to do is map it out.

132
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,400
Correctly mapping out a process before
building it is going to ensure that you

133
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:35,700
have visibility on one, do you have
an understanding of the task of the

134
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:39,680
predictable set of actions
that the task represents?

135
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:44,300
Two, it's going to give you more
visibility on the different tools,

136
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,880
apps, or actions that
are going to be used.

137
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,620
Three, it's going to give you
more visibility on the feasibility.

138
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,540
Nothing is worse than spending half an
hour, an hour, or two hours building an

139
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:02,720
automation to then realize at the
end that it actually isn't possible.

140
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,780
Mapping out the workflow is also
going to help you estimate the workload.

141
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:12,860
How long is it going to take
me to automate this task?

142
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,820
And finally, sometimes
mapping out the workflow is going

143
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:21,280
to show you where you might
need some human intervention.

144
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:29,280
If the task you want to automate cannot
be mapped out into a predetermined set of

145
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:34,360
actions, then you might need some
human intervention in that workflow.

146
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,630
In the advanced course,
we'll cover how you can use AI

147
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:42,840
to sometimes relieve the
need for human intervention.

148
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,820
So how do you map an automation?

149
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,940
The first thing you want
to do is create a flow chart.

150
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,800
And there are many different
ways you can create this flow chart.

151
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,700
You can use Miro,
FigJam, or any other tool.

152
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,816
And what you want to
do is you want to list every

153
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:05,000
different part of the process
as an individual block.

154
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,480
Then working left to right, you're going
to want to link these different blocks

155
00:11:13,481 --> 00:11:16,140
with arrows, depending
on how they interact.

156
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,540
So if we take the example from earlier, we
start the workflow with a form submission.

157
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,320
So we're going to create a first
block, call it form submission.

158
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,517
Then the next step in
the automation is we need

159
00:11:29,518 --> 00:11:32,400
to filter depending on
which kind of company.

160
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,880
So here we create a block.

161
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:35,160
What kind of company?

162
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,980
And from that block, we create all of
these different arrows depending on what

163
00:11:40,981 --> 00:11:44,280
kind of company and what
the different options are.

164
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,380
Then we're going to link these,
this question to the final actions.

165
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,085
So adding an email to sequence
or adding the data to a Google

166
00:11:55,086 --> 00:11:57,960
sheet or sending the information
to an account manager.

167
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,860
These maps can be a lot more
complicated than the given example.

168
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:07,862
And especially for those much
more complicated examples,

169
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:11,960
it is very much worth
taking the time to map it out.

170
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:17,060
If while mapping it out, you realize
that something is unclear, then this is

171
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:18,835
something that you need
to make sure that you

172
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:21,501
understand before starting
building the workflow.

173
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,777
Because again, it would
be a shame to get to the

174
00:12:23,778 --> 00:12:26,421
end and realize that it
actually isn't feasible.

175
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,760
This was the first video for
the n8n beginner course.

176
00:12:32,761 --> 00:12:38,500
In the next video, we will be covering
webhooks and APIs, two very important

177
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:42,580
notions that you need to understand
before building your first n8n workflows.

178
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,180
Thank you and see
you in the next video.
