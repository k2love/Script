00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,320
Hello.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,420
This is Isayangjobs.

3
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:07,420
I’m quite attached to my subscribers, viewers, and membership members as well.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,640
I’m quite attached to them.

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,440
So, without realizing it, I sometimes say things that are a bit presumptuous.

6
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,880
I call it mental care, but I think there are parts where I’m nagging a bit.

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,840
The reason is, this blog, you know.

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,260
Making money with a blog.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,900
You just write, you know?

10
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,237
It doesn’t require any special skills.

11
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:32,120
I’ve told you a lot of things, but I always mention in the comments and videos that you just need to write.

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,257
It’s the same for me.

13
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:34,740
I’m not a special person or anything.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,020
You just have to write, and writing just translates into money.

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,720
Even if it takes some time, it's simply a job where writing turns into money.

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,980
You don't have to deal with people, compare yourself to others, or engage in so-called office politics.

17
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,840
You don't have to manage people, and you get paid.

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,160
You just have to write, so why can't you do it?

19
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,960
Why can't our viewers do it?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,236
Why is it like that, our subscribers?

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,600
I think about this a lot.

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,220
I feel like I think about this every day.

23
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:07,957
So, instead of telling you about various techniques, I’m constantly thinking about that, and I end up talking about it under the guise of mental care, but I was so

24
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:14,180
used to it, but I was also able to do these things from a young age with someone’s help.

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,400
Especially children, there are things they can’t understand on their own if they don’t learn them.

26
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,497
And there are cases where learning something at a young age can help you for a long time.

27
00:01:22,521 --> 00:01:24,400
I’d like to tell you about one of those things.

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:35,237
What I’m telling you today, is that you will make more money from your blog than your salary, spend freely on things you want, and not live to make money, but rather

29
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:42,020
live in a way where money doesn't hinder you from doing the things you want to do, the things you feel like you have to do. I hope this becomes that kind of opportunity.

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:42,977
And what is it?

31
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:44,180
You guys guess it.

32
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,040
You have to manage your condition.

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,997
You do.

34
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:51,580
When you watch my videos or other people's videos on YouTube about how to make money,

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,420
or Instagram,

36
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,780
there's Instagram and AI, there's a lot, and while you're watching that, the thought comes to you.

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,380
"I think I can do this."

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,660
That incredible idea looks very brilliant.

39
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,460
So you go to your desk, pick up your phone, bring your Macbook, and you just have to write.

40
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,900
But this doesn't work.

41
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,180
This.

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,420
Getting from here to the desk doesn't work.

43
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:18,340
You go to your desk, turn on your Macbook, write some text, and log into WordPress, but in that time, you’re holding your phone and doing something else.

44
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,496
Playing games, or looking at Instagram, or watching YouTube Shorts, or WordPress.

45
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,980
Or searching on Google, or searching on Naver.

46
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,920
This doesn't work.

47
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,240
This.

48
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,440
In between, this doesn't work.

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,200
Why doesn't it work?

50
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,280
Is it a matter of willpower?

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:29,800
No, it's not.

52
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,240
Everyone,

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,840
It’s not that you don’t want to do it, it’s that you are not in the condition to do it right now.

54
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,480
Your physical strength isn't keeping up, and you don’t have the mental capacity.

55
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:46,340
People look very strong, but if your condition isn’t good, you’re not in a state to do it, so it’s impossible.

56
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,456
You absolutely can’t do it.

57
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,000
So you have to manage your condition.

58
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,160
How do you manage it?

59
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,440
"I'm struggling to make a living."

60
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,040
"I leave early in the morning and come back late at night."

61
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,640
I said I've done a lot of different jobs, but I've also done a lot of on-site work.

62
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,320
Doing what's called “Nogada” (construction work).

63
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,360
I've spent all day lifting formwork, and hoisting it up.

64
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,380
Until I finished unloading the set amount of sand for the day.

65
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,340
“Yarikkiri” they call it.

66
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,080
I did a lot of that.

67
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,000
I've also carried bricks for days.

68
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,220
I've been to old houses and laid down the floor boiler and done plastering.

69
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,400
I’ve done these kinds of jobs.

70
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:21,100
When I came home, I didn't even have the strength to shower. I’ve actually face-planted onto the keyboard in front of the computer.

71
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,500
And I’d fall asleep without realizing it.

72
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,200
That’s not to say Nogada was the hardest job I had, there were harder ones.

73
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,980
How am I supposed to manage my condition when it's this hard?

74
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,280
That's what you might be thinking.

75
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,840
But, I told you the story of when I was young, didn’t I?

76
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,820
When I was young, a certain great person,

77
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,820
a great man, a historical figure.

78
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,380
One of the things that I heard from that great person was this phrase.

79
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,880
Am I sounding too solemn?

80
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,840
That self-control was necessary, so self-control.

81
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,780
What does that mean?

82
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,140
I’ll tell you simply.

83
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,640
What time is the most fun time of your day?

84
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,500
For me, it's exactly 11 PM.

85
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,357
11 PM.

86
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:59,016
From 11 PM, my eyes are wide awake, everything is fun, TV is fun, phones are fun, reading books is fun.

87
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,840
Everything is fun.

88
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,720
It’s so much fun.

89
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,340
That's when I get really excited.

90
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,416
So, this is when I excitedly start doing things.

91
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,600
I do the dishes, watch movies, do everything.

92
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,740
What time is it then?

93
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,156
1:30 AM.

94
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:11,520
When?

95
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,200
Early morning.

96
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,276
Even then, I can’t fall asleep.

97
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,300
Because it’s too much fun.

98
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay, that's good.

99
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,580
Do what you want with your free time.

100
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,840
What happens in the morning?

101
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,620
You're definitely tired in the morning.

102
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,680
Like me, because I am the CEO.

103
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:22,720
I’m tired, right?

104
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,780
I do whatever I want because I am the CEO of my company, but CEOs usually don't come late.

105
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,060
It’s the employees who are late.

106
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,380
But people who go to work are sleepy from the morning.

107
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:31,640
Just.

108
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,680
By the time you can properly get into work, it will be around noon to get your mind in the right space.

109
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,420
And your physical condition still won’t be back.

110
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,980
In the evening, after working all day, you're like, “Phew, I barely made it through the day”.

111
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,640
You barely made it, so what?

112
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,840
You have to unwind, right?

113
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,460
Have a good dinner, have a beer, watch OTT at home. Then what do you do?

114
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,600
You have to do WordPress, right?

115
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,180
WordPress.

116
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:52,940
Can you do it?

117
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,680
You can't.

118
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,400
It's not that you don't want to do it, but you don't have any energy left.

119
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
You need self-control.

120
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,480
What do you need?

121
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,460
No matter how much fun 11 PM is, you shouldn’t be playing until 1:30 AM.

122
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:11,240
At that time, you may have the energy and are too excited to feel tired, but if you don’t restrain yourself at this time, you can’t do what you want to do the next morning.

123
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,360
You should play until 11 and go to bed at 12.

124
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,740
Or you can choose not to play and go to bed at 11.

125
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,500
I’m not talking about insomnia here, because that’s not what I'm trying to say.

126
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:26,440
If you use all of your energy at this most fun and happy time, you won’t have the strength to do WordPress.

127
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
There’s one way.

128
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:38,040
At this time, don't read books, don't watch Shorts, don't do Instagram, when your condition is best, what you should do is, try doing the things that feel the hardest.

129
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,220
What should you do at 11?

130
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,696
At 11?

131
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,400
Do WordPress at this time.

132
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:47,420
The fun time, in other words, when your condition is best, that’s when you should do WordPress.

133
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,400
So shall we draw a daily schedule?

134
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,640
Like this.

135
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
8 o’clock.

136
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,840
12 o'clock.

137
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
6 o'clock.

138
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,380
Check the time of the day when your condition is at its best.

139
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,060
Do it once.

140
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,220
Do it comfortably.

141
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,912
You might be going to school, or work, or you might be doing what you want all day, like me.

142
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:08,860
But you have to find the time when your condition is the best from this list.

143
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,780
You have to write on WordPress at this time, and also write what you are doing at this time.

144
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,137
When your condition is best.

145
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:21,260
More often than not, you’re doing things that you don’t have to do during your peak condition.

146
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,440
And you're probably trying to do the things you have to do during the times when you're not at your best.

147
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:36,577
I'm not telling you to live ascetically, or to live a boring life forever, but at first you have to be able to show this level of self-control so that, to a certain extent,

148
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:46,637
once you're more stable, you can play when your condition is the best, you can get enough sleep when your condition is the best, but if you don't do that, you'll always make money, go to work,

149
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:55,300
start in the dark, fail, empathize with other people’s stories of failure, and think, "It's not that I’m the only one who’s failed, but that 100 people,

150
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:02,640
1,000 people, 10,000 people have also failed," and then start WordPress again, and you can stop repeating this cycle.

151
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:09,554
Everyone, first, check what you’re doing when your condition is best, and when your condition is worst.

152
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:15,080
If you check, you'll see that you're doing WordPress blogs or other things you need to do when your condition is bad.

153
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,200
And when your condition is good, you're probably having fun.

154
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:18,980
This is...

155
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,140
I'm not criticizing you, I was like that myself, and then that person told me about “self-control”, what self-control?

156
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:28,720
He told me once how to restrain myself from having fun when my condition is good, he didn't even say much.

157
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,460
But it was very shocking at that time.

158
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:37,000
And then, after that, after I started doing the things that felt hardest when my condition was good, my life became very comfortable.

159
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,680
It's not like I did WordPress from a very young age.

160
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,760
What did I do then, for example, let’s say I thought I needed to read a book.

161
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,140
Reading books is very hard.

162
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,600
My eyes get sleepy when I just look at books.

163
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,137
My eyes just close as soon as I look at a book.

164
00:07:48,161 --> 00:07:49,500
There are probably people like that, right?

165
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,180
Why is that?

166
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,320
It's not that the book is not interesting, it's that you're reading a book when you're sleepy and at your worst.

167
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,260
You put it off, and put it off, and put it off, and then think, "I'll read a page or two before I go to bed.”

168
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,060
Then you can sleep like a baby as soon as you look at a book.

169
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,320
You are doing the things that you feel like you have to do at the worst possible time.

170
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,500
Do you exercise?

171
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,920
I exercise a lot.

172
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,160
Even if I don't exercise, I always pay for a year membership.

173
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:12,700
That’s one of the ways I do things, it’s not that I have the money to pay for it, but at what time do you exercise?

174
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
You have to do it at the best time of day to be able to keep doing it without stopping.

175
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,737
It’s not after doing all the things you want to do,

176
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:21,800
or eating all the things you want to eat, you should exercise and then do those things.

177
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:30,200
I'm not talking about priority, but rather things you have to do for the first time, things that haven't been established yet, it's hard to do them when your condition is bad.

178
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,855
And one more thing, I mentioned self-control, but in order to do the things you have to do, for example, this you’re watching right now,

179
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:42,980
is first being released to our membership members, and it will probably be released to general subscribers a month or more later.

180
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,280
It’s August 29th right now.

181
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,220
I'm recording this in the evening right now, at 11:48 PM, which is when I feel the most excited, so what happens on September 10th?

182
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,280
It should come out right away, but on September 10th, the iPhone 16 will be announced.

183
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,740
The iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro Max, and 16 Pro are being announced.

184
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,000
This time, AI and new buttons will be added, so sales are expected to be quite high.

185
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,220
If you've found out about this, what you need to do is write fast.

186
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,740
The iPhone 16, 16 is ten days from now, or eleven days from now, isn’t it?

187
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:20,180
So, during the time that your condition is best, you need to write a blog post about the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Pro.

188
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,666
If you don't know what this is, of course, I might upload a few videos, but if you don’t know, you should be getting the information

189
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:31,120
for using the iPhone 16 model right now, when your condition is best.

190
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
You need to prepare for this.

191
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,540
From now on, you need to focus.

192
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,960
When your condition is best, it’s absolutely about the iPhone 16.

193
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,380
Do you know this right now?

194
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,300
Do you know the show called “I am Solo”?

195
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,320
“I am Solo” is arguably the most talked about show in Korea.

196
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,757
And it will likely be for a very long time.

197
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:52,240
It airs every Wednesday, and I used to make a bit of money from it a long time ago, do you guys write about it?

198
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,720
There’s so many blog posts online about it.

199
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,020
They go up every week.

200
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,260
It becomes an issue just after Wednesday passes.

201
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,380
Just after Wednesday passes, the search volume explodes from Wednesday evening.

202
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,380
Do you enjoy watching “I am Solo”?

203
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,200
Do you write about it?

204
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:11,282
I’m not blaming you, but while you’re enjoying watching “I am Solo”, you have to consider what content will become an issue.

205
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:15,737
After it ends, you are watching it enjoyably by reading other people's blog posts.

206
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:23,860
If you want to write a blog post on WordPress, you need to have the condition to watch “I am Solo” and the condition to write a blog post.

207
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,560
And after watching “I am Solo,” you should write a blog post on WordPress right away.

208
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,620
It will be past 11 o’clock.

209
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,740
It might be 12 o’clock.

210
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,800
It can't be helped.

211
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,580
This is the season.

212
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,560
What season?

213
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Every Thursday at 00:00, "I'm writing about I am Solo."

214
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,480
Some people even write while watching “I am Solo.”

215
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,100
But you can choose, but anyway, those things,

216
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,736
You watch “I am Solo” and you have to work at 12 AM.

217
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,100
“I have to work."

218
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:55,040
Instead of this, no matter if it's 12 or 1 o’clock, to write it after you’ve become certain that it will have an effect, you need to be in good condition.

219
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,520
I told you the iPhone 16 is coming out soon.

220
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,900
September 10th, what time?

221
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,300
It comes out at 2 AM.

222
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
2 AM, really?

223
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:08,660
I'll be struggling to pre-order it from Coupang, but Apple events usually happen in the early morning.

224
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,840
They usually start after 2 AM.

225
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,577
But even though I may have published a post ahead of time, that time is when new information comes out.

226
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:15,980
All the previous publications are rumors.

227
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:24,440
After the actual information comes out, I write a post, and I also do some video production, so in order to do that, I barely sleep from 2 AM on the day of the announcement.

228
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,120
But if you don't sleep during that time, you get shingles.

229
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
It's happened to me a few times.

230
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,560
So, I have to choose.

231
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,180
Because you can’t get shingles, you definitely shouldn’t stay up all night.

232
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,640
But for this, I manage my condition starting two days before.

233
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,840
I avoid stress, and even if it's fun at night, I go to bed early.

234
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,060
I do it from two days before.

235
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,540
Even if I can’t fall asleep, I close my eyes.

236
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,880
I don't tire my eyes out.

237
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,897
I don't tire my body out.

238
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:44,921
I don't even go to the gym.

239
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,300
Why?

240
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
For the sake of my condition that day.

241
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,060
I do that for my condition on September 10th.

242
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,620
If you don't do that, you'll ruin your health.

243
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,760
Or you won’t be able to write a post during those important times.

244
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
Why do I go this far?

245
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,940
I told you that there are a few peak seasons throughout the year, right?

246
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:05,640
It’s not that I’m telling you to live like this all year, but on the days that are peak season, you need to be in good enough shape to write, or else your body won’t be able to, and you won’t be able to write.

247
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,900
You know that saying,

248
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,300
“A sound mind in a sound body.”

249
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,017
“A sound body in a sound mind.”

250
00:12:13,041 --> 00:12:13,540
What does that mean?

251
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,680
You need both.

252
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,060
Both.

253
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,980
You have to have a positive mind.

254
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,600
And you have to manage your condition well.

255
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:25,280
It’s not good, but if you don't manage your condition, and you think you can do it with your will, it's a bit arrogant.

256
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,200
I have acquaintances who do blogs and things I do, and there's an acquaintance who is really good at it.

257
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,260
It’s astonishing.

258
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,960
I’m always asking them about things.

259
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,579
It's been a while, but when they first started, they met with me for one day, and then after that,

260
00:12:37,603 --> 00:12:41,700
they didn't do anything else, and from the day they ordered their Macbook, they only do this.

261
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,257
What is it?

262
00:12:42,281 --> 00:12:43,360
Digital Nomad.

263
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,556
They only do things related to digital nomad.

264
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,360
They don't do anything else.

265
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,840
You shouldn't overdo it too much, but,

266
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,120
In other words, what does that mean?

267
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,320
They are doing this during the time when their condition is best.

268
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,540
They don’t ruin their condition with other things.

269
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,900
Everyone, you might feel like I spoke a bit randomly, but write down a clock once.

270
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,480
And write down what you’re doing when your condition is best.

271
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,920
When your condition is best, you're probably playing.

272
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,700
When your condition is best, you're probably lying down and watching TV.

273
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,837
So instead of watching TV or lying down, or reading a book,

274
00:13:11,861 --> 00:13:15,180
I'm not saying you shouldn't do it, do these things when your condition isn’t good.

275
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,360
I recommend that you write a post when your condition is good.

276
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:26,660
Also, if there is an exact timing that you need to write a post, even if your body feels okay, try to manage your condition ahead of time for that time, and then,

277
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,300
like I said at the beginning, the worry I have,

278
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,160
"Why can’t I make money when I write?"

279
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,380
The answer to that worry will definitely be solved.

280
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
Okay, I'll stop here for today.

281
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
This was Isayangjobs.

282
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,200
See you next time.

283
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,720
Goodbye.
