1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,041
$100 while working, $200 while sleeping.

2
00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:12,180
I've finally applied for channel monetization, surpassing 1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:16,300
Since I already had an AdSense account, I used that existing one.

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,240
I believe it's all thanks to you, my subscribers, and I'll share everything I can.

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,480
I said I'd share what I can, right?

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,860
There are things I really can't.

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,537
If I reveal those, my channel will be ruined.

8
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:32,340
But if you follow what I'm teaching now, you'll eventually figure it out on your own.

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,521
The moment you understand that, you’ll be making so much money, it'll make even Steve Jobs look like an amateur.

10
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:41,746
So, don't worry too much about it, and I'll share everything I can.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,760
The AdSense ecosystem keeps changing.

12
00:00:43,906 --> 00:00:46,833
The logic of Daum, Google, and Naver also keeps changing.

13
00:00:46,857 --> 00:00:51,646
I'll try to keep up with those changes as quickly as possible and share what I learn.

14
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,825
So keep getting great information through me, your Isayang Jobs.

15
00:00:54,849 --> 00:00:59,900
And whenever you feel shaky as a digital nomad, stay strong and keep going.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,800
Also, I'm constantly expanding my pipelines.

17
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,640
I don't know how far I’ll go.

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,180
For example, you invest in stocks or real estate, right?

19
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:13,154
In the digital nomad world, we do AdSense, AdPost, Coupang Partners, and so on.

20
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:16,300
But you can't rely on just those because the income fluctuates a lot.

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,080
AdSense is relatively more stable in terms of income.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,435
AdSense is what gives you a steady income,

23
00:01:22,513 --> 00:01:25,315
but the others aren't stable yet.

24
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:30,528
So, you need to keep expanding your pipelines, build a base with the ones that survive,

25
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:32,711
and then keep adding more pipelines.

26
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:38,831
To create a new pipeline, you need to have stable lines already in place.

27
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:43,983
If you do that, you’ll keep adding new things, and eventually, you'll be able to earn money even if you do almost nothing.

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,980
Or, you can just post what you need to. Right now, you write blog posts even when you don't want to.

29
00:01:49,173 --> 00:01:50,821
Because it's trending, right?

30
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:57,184
You write informational posts after studying, even when you don’t know what they're about. But once things stabilize,

31
00:01:57,331 --> 00:02:03,000
you can write about what you know well, what you want to share, and your income will still be stable.

32
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:06,853
That's great, isn't it? Let's keep going together until then.

33
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:13,226
Okay, today, as I mentioned in the title, and now that I have ads, I'll try to place them well.

34
00:02:13,373 --> 00:02:16,000
For us AdSense users, especially bloggers,

35
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:21,033
the click-through rate varies greatly depending on where you place ads.

36
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:25,056
In my previous video, I showed you how to use mobile full-screen ads.

37
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,256
Like that, for us digital nomads doing AdSense,

38
00:02:28,368 --> 00:02:33,300
writing articles and creating videos are important, but strategic ad placement is also important.

39
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:38,423
I'll try to place ads well on my YouTube channel too, according to the content I make.

40
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:40,303
Please support me, I'm counting on you.

41
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,130
I think my channel will last a long time if you do.

42
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:47,583
I'll always be grateful, and let's start today.

43
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,983
Today, what I want to show you is...

44
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,290
I want to talk about top ads.

45
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:53,710
You place top ads, right?

46
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,605
Whether you’ve been doing YouTube or AdSense for a long time or not,

47
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:03,508
the place with the highest click-through rate and the highest revenue is the top ad.

48
00:03:03,675 --> 00:03:06,495
So, we can't not put ads at the top.

49
00:03:06,655 --> 00:03:09,928
Since we can’t avoid it, we cannot overlook this point.

50
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:14,614
How you place the top ads can affect your session duration, bounce rate,

51
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,768
and even your cost per click (CPC).

52
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:19,688
So, you need to place them smartly.

53
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:23,886
You’ve just been placing them and maintaining them because they made money, right?

54
00:03:24,026 --> 00:03:25,026
So you just think, "Whatever."

55
00:03:25,165 --> 00:03:29,940
You don't want to deal with the headache of figuring it out, so you stick with it because it's making money.

56
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:32,666
That might not be helpful in the long run.

57
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:36,174
Today, I'll tell you about a few types of top ad placements.

58
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:38,508
First, there are people who place them like this.

59
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:42,528
The first top ad placement I'll show you is like this:

60
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:45,373
When it's above the title when you enter the page.

61
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:51,153
In this case, the ad might be seen first, but the problem is, what happens if the ad doesn't load quickly?

62
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,146
It appears as a blank space. Then people will scroll down right away.

63
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:58,219
These days, phone speeds and internet speeds are faster,

64
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:02,759
so if it doesn't load within a fraction of a second, people notice and scroll down immediately.

65
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,840
As someone who plays an instrument, you know the hands are faster than the eyes. So if it doesn't load, you scroll.

66
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,108
So, even if you want to show it immediately, if it doesn't load, they scroll down.

67
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:17,886
Also, if there's an ad as soon as you enter, what comes to mind? Those clickbait pages written by clickbait journalists.

68
00:04:17,993 --> 00:04:21,046
If they hate that, they might leave the page right away.

69
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,740
Another one is an ad right below the title.

70
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:28,100
I showed you how to place it in the skin editing in my previous video.

71
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,753
Once you place it there, just like the previous one,

72
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:35,899
if you put the ad code in the skin editor, it will automatically appear.

73
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:37,140
It's very convenient.

74
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:42,691
And it loads faster than the Kakao account linked version, which is why I recommended it before.

75
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:46,058
But, when you do it this way, it's the same here too.

76
00:04:46,205 --> 00:04:49,900
If the ad doesn't load right away here either, it will appear blank.

77
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:53,196
And people might think it doesn't look good.

78
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,643
Or they might think there's nothing there and scroll up before even seeing the ad.

79
00:04:57,783 --> 00:05:03,403
So, placing ads above like this should be a conscious decision, except for specific situations.

80
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,636
I'll explain later when placing these ads can be beneficial.

81
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:12,228
But for now, I'm talking about creating a pension-like blog.

82
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:15,755
Not a post that you use for two or three days and throw away.

83
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:19,694
I'm talking about blog posts that will keep generating income,

84
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:24,861
and you want the session duration to keep going up.

85
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:30,675
In that case, putting ads above the title, or the ad appearing before the main content,

86
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:32,862
clearly contributes to a higher bounce rate,

87
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:37,087
and reduces readability, so I don't recommend it.

88
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:39,880
So, what do I recommend? It's this:

89
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,763
As you can see here, you understand, right?

90
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:47,870
When someone first comes to your page, what they want most should be at the top.

91
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:51,615
It shouldn't start with an ad and ruin the design.

92
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:55,373
The title comes first. The title appears first, followed by the main content.

93
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:59,564
The main content appears for about four or five lines. And then the ad appears.

94
00:05:59,704 --> 00:06:03,184
It's still a link ad, so I used a link ad as an example.

95
00:06:03,317 --> 00:06:09,083
If you read the text above, you’ll be willing to wait until the ad loads even if it's a little delayed.

96
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:12,896
If you place the ad in this area, you will definitely see the ad.

97
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,504
So, it's a great method.

98
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:17,870
And I told you before to put the description at the top.

99
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:22,523
So, the most important information, the answer, should be in the first paragraph.

100
00:06:22,662 --> 00:06:26,137
So that people can read the content in the introduction while waiting for the ad to load, for 1 second or 0.5 seconds.

101
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:30,369
They can read the content in the introduction while waiting for the ad to load.

102
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:34,785
The ad appears here. But it might not be an ad they like.

103
00:06:34,905 --> 00:06:37,290
Or they might want to see the content below.

104
00:06:37,484 --> 00:06:38,850
What will they do then? They will scroll down.

105
00:06:39,004 --> 00:06:44,299
When they scroll down, the H2 tag appears with a title and the main content continues.

106
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:48,032
But as you can see, while reading this main content, they see another ad.

107
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:52,482
The ad should be placed so it can be seen anywhere on the page.

108
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:53,877
It shouldn't be like this, for example:

109
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:57,012
If the content covers the ad,

110
00:06:57,197 --> 00:07:01,787
people can easily scroll past the ad without seeing it.

111
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:07,573
So for example, they see the first paragraph and then see the first ad.

112
00:07:07,686 --> 00:07:09,726
But they don't want to see the ad, so they cover it.

113
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:13,242
Does covering it mean they won't see the ad? They will still see it.

114
00:07:13,429 --> 00:07:19,521
If you design it like this, the ad will continue to be visible. If a targeted or contextual ad appears,

115
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,635
they will likely click on it if they like it.

116
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:26,027
We tend to place ads carelessly, but especially these kinds of ads are not good.

117
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,167
There's a paragraph, then an ad, and then another ad below it.

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,073
If you do this, the ad will be right under the first ad.

119
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:35,268
You can scroll past all of it without seeing it.

120
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:39,756
So when you place ads, don't assume people will only look at the ads.

121
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:44,709
They will be looking at the main content, and the ads will naturally be within their peripheral vision.

122
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:49,480
You need to keep that in mind. They'll see it like this. They'll see the second one like this.

123
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:52,402
For example, as I mentioned before, nobody looks at it like this.

124
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:55,826
Nobody likes ads so much that they look at them like this.

125
00:07:56,053 --> 00:07:59,200
If it's placed like this, they will naturally look at it this way.

126
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:03,466
Like I said before, just put two ads at the top, somehow.

127
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:07,885
Place them there, and when there is good content in the middle, don't put too many ads.

128
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:10,900
And place ads at the very end. So they can make a decision then.

129
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:13,625
Or they can scroll back up and click the ad. I told you about that before.

130
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:16,470
Do you agree? Placing the ads like this.

131
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:21,785
If you want to set it up as the third method that I suggested,

132
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,248
how can we achieve this when we write a post?

133
00:08:25,448 --> 00:08:26,795
I'll show you.

134
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:30,761
This is the new post page of my Isayang Jobs website.

135
00:08:30,941 --> 00:08:38,293
First, write the title: "Ads will soon be on the Isayang Jobs YouTube channel."

136
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,520
Thank you for subscribing.

137
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,613
Okay, I'm just writing that for fun.

138
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:46,105
I told you about the description before, right?

139
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:48,058
Write the description part.

140
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:52,458
If you just do what Google tells you to, it will naturally work out.

141
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:56,830
For example, let's say I wrote a description like this. 160 characters.

142
00:08:56,996 --> 00:09:02,165
"The Isayang Jobs channel will soon have ads thanks to the great love of subscribers."

143
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:05,754
I’m new to YouTube, so the ad placements might be annoying,

144
00:09:05,948 --> 00:09:11,296
but if you keep supporting me as you have been, I will provide you with more tips as an AdSense and digital nomad.

145
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:14,719
I will give you tips on how to have an easygoing life.

146
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,473
I've subtly revealed my true feelings, and now you've written the description.

147
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:21,619
We agreed to write the description like this, right?

148
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,266
Then you can put an ad.

149
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:26,484
Leave a space and create the ad placement.

150
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:31,351
Create it like this and then, here is the top ad placement method.

151
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,064
An H2 tag will be placed like this.

152
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:37,043
The tag will be inserted, and more content will be below it.

153
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:38,700
Content will be written like this.

154
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:42,696
So, one space here, two spaces here. This is my style. I like this.

155
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,667
I don't like to put them too close together.

156
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,287
I like to clearly show the ads.

157
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:52,631
And then, go to the HTML and place the AdSense ad in this part.

158
00:09:52,804 --> 00:09:58,099
Then, when you return, it will be like this. This is the ad part. Some people place ads using the form,

159
00:09:58,204 --> 00:10:00,247
but in my experience, this is just my feeling,

160
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:05,836
it seems like the new editor breaks the AdSense ads a little more when you place them using the form.

161
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:07,036
It may not be true.

162
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:12,229
So, it's your choice, but I still place ads directly using the HTML code.

163
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:17,617
So, put in two lines of description, leave one space, and place the AdSense ad.

164
00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:20,615
Leave two spaces and then start writing your content.

165
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:23,776
Just like we saw on the blog, the first four lines.

166
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:28,205
On a typical phone, whether it's an iPhone or Galaxy, the main content will appear for about four lines.

167
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:32,343
The title will be above it, and the ad will take up 50% of the rest of the screen.

168
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:34,317
You only need to place one ad here.

169
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:37,194
If you put two, what happens is you look at the ad, right?

170
00:10:37,367 --> 00:10:40,301
You see it and scroll down. And then there's another ad.

171
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:42,121
Then you will start to quickly scroll down.

172
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:45,000
And then it doesn't go the way we intended.

173
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:46,696
So, just one ad here.

174
00:10:46,823 --> 00:10:51,603
Whether you put a display ad or a link ad, place it like this.

175
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:55,401
Then you can use the top ads like this.

176
00:10:55,555 --> 00:11:00,783
The method I didn't recommend before is the one above, this one.

177
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:03,112
This method can cause the ad to load slowly.

178
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:05,754
And even if the ad loads, people didn't come to see the ad.

179
00:11:05,825 --> 00:11:09,182
They scroll down, and they can push away the ad and just view the content.

180
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,462
Even putting an ad above the title might be good in some cases.

181
00:11:13,532 --> 00:11:15,612
If you’re only focusing on trending keywords, it's a bit different.

182
00:11:15,772 --> 00:11:18,340
For trending keywords, you need to put a lot of ads.

183
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:21,610
Because you'll only be using the post for three or four days.

184
00:11:21,743 --> 00:11:27,955
It's a post that's going to bring in 50,000 visitors in 3 days, attracting 10,000 or 15,000 visitors a day, and then you will throw it away.

185
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,726
So, session duration is not important.

186
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:33,546
You need to make sure people see the ads as much as possible.

187
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:38,339
So, you can put them above, here, there, and even put two ads at a time.

188
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:40,111
Doing it this way is effective.

189
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:45,740
The top ad placement that I'm talking about now is for posts that you want to keep ranking on Google,

190
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,967
that you want to use like a pension, and if you write really good, valuable content,

191
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:55,758
that users will find helpful,

192
00:11:55,998 --> 00:12:01,988
placing the ads before the main content isn't very helpful, that’s what I’m trying to say.

193
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:04,124
I used to put them at the very top.

194
00:12:04,284 --> 00:12:10,359
I would always put them at the top and place as many ads as possible, here, there, in the middle, everywhere.

195
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:15,243
As a result, the speed was slow, and there was no improvement. It was all just hard work.

196
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,230
I was doing a lot of digital labor.

197
00:12:17,372 --> 00:12:19,964
But after changing my ad placements,

198
00:12:20,196 --> 00:12:24,757
the posts that were generating revenue had a higher click-through rate, higher revenue,

199
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:27,748
and were more stable. And as a content provider,

200
00:12:27,861 --> 00:12:32,651
I used to feel a sense of shame for writing clickbait and things like that.

201
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:34,347
I didn't feel good about it.

202
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:37,161
I always said to my wife,

203
00:12:37,246 --> 00:12:43,056
I would say “This clickbait is really hard on my mental health.”

204
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:48,796
But now, while I expect the revenue to naturally come, I'm writing the content to be most helpful for users.

205
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:53,201
And I started thinking about the ad placement while I was trying to do that.

206
00:12:53,454 --> 00:12:59,222
I thought about how to do it in a way that is helpful to the users and doesn’t violate Google AdSense policies.

207
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:04,328
As a result, it actually became helpful to the users, and as the poster, I didn't feel ashamed.

208
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,633
Right, and the revenue went up.

209
00:13:06,793 --> 00:13:09,645
Of course, I'm not saying this is the correct answer.

210
00:13:09,741 --> 00:13:13,573
There may be other ways that work well when it comes to top ads, but

211
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:17,461
If there are people who want to get help from my experience,

212
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,439
then I recommend doing this.

213
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:22,745
So, if you want to create a valuable main blog,

214
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:26,747
a blog that will keep increasing in value like a pension,

215
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:32,675
when you place top ads, let go of your greed and place them from the user's perspective.

216
00:13:32,888 --> 00:13:34,731
Okay, that's it for today.

217
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:38,151
There's one more thing I want to mention about top ads.

218
00:13:38,311 --> 00:13:40,860
I'll talk about that again soon.

219
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,308
Until then, try this and see how it goes, I'd be interested in your results.

220
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:48,129
Ads are most important for us.

221
00:13:48,255 --> 00:13:50,469
The Isayang Jobs channel is also very important.

222
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:51,826
Please take care of us.

223
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:52,579
Thank you.

224
00:13:52,766 --> 00:13:54,072
This was Isayang Jobs.
